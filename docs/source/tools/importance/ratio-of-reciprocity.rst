Ratio of Reciprocity
--------------------

Ratio of Reciprocity is a simple ratio of the number of incoming transactions to the number of outgoing transactions. This produces an importance score where lower scores indicate more one-sided relationships, and higher scores indicate more reciprocal relationships. You can use this to compare the neighbours of a node and rank them in order from most reciprocated to most one-sided.
