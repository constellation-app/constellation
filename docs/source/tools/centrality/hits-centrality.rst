HITS Centrality
---------------

Hyperlink-Induced Topic Search (HITS) Centrality is a special centrality measure which generates a pair of scores for each node, a Hub score and an Authority score. The idea behind this is that authorities tend to generate information, and so will not have many outward connections, whereas hubs tend to disseminate information, and so will have many outward connections (likely connected to authorities).
