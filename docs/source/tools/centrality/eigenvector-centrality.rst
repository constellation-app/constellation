Eigenvector Centrality
----------------------

Eigenvector Centrality is an extension of Degree Centrality, which scores a node based not only by its neighbours, but also by the influence of those neighbours. This is done by calculating the largest eigenvalue associated with the eigenvector of each node in the graph, hence the name.
