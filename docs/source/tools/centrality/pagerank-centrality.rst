Pagerank Centrality
-------------------

Pagerank Centrality essentially measures the influence of a node in a network - the more influential a node is, the more important it is considered. While Degree Centrality assigning an importance point for every neighbour a node has, Pagerank Centrality expands on this by taking into account how important each neighbour is, and uses this information to score the importance of a node.
