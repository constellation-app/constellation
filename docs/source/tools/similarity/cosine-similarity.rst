Cosine Similarity
-----------------

Cosine Similarity, in general, is used to determine how similar two vectors are based on the cosine of the angle between them. For a graph, these vectors are composed of features or behaviours represented by the network (eg. node A contacted node B, node A is correlated to node B). This basically results in a high similarity score being assigned to any pair of nodes which are connected to similar neighbours a similar amount of times.
