Jaccard Index
-------------

Jaccard Index, in general, is used to determine how similar two sets are based on difference between their intersection and their union. For a graph, these sets are composed of the neighbours of each node, resulting in a high similarity score being assigned to any pair of nodes which are connected to similar neighbours.
