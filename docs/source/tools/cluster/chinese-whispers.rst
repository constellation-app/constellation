Chinese Whispers Clustering
---------------------------

*Chinese Whispers - an Efficient Graph Clustering Algorithm and its Application to Natural Language Processing Problems.*

Intuitively, the algorithm works as follows in a bottom-up fashion: First all nodes get different classes. Then the nodes are processed for a small number of iterations and inherit the strongest class in the local neighborhood. This is the class whose sum of edge weights to the current node is maximal. In case of multiple strongest classes, one is chosen randomly. Regions of the same class stabilize during the iteration and grow until they reach the border of a stable region of another class. Note that classes are updated immediately: a node can obtain classes from the neighborhood that were introduced there in the same iteration.

              initialize:
              for all v\ :sub:`i`\  in V:
                class(v\ :sub:`i`\ ) = i
              while changes:
                for all v in V, randomized order:
                  class(v) = highest ranked class in neighborhood of v;
  
Apart from ties, the classes usually do not change any more after a handful of iterations. The number of iterations depends on the diameter of the graph: the larger the distance between two nodes is, the more iterations it takes to percolate information from one to another.

Chinese Whispers in CONSTELLATION makes use of overlay colors. When the clustering algorithm has been run, each cluster is assigned a unique color. Node backgrounds and intra-cluster transactions are colored using the cluster's color, while inter-cluster transactions are colored dark grey.

Rather than set the color directly, Chinese Whispers in CONSTELLATION creates a new color attribute and tells Constellation to display the graph using the new attribute. To switch back to the default color attribute, use Edit â†’ Color attribute selection.

When the clustering algorithm runs, no arrangement is done, so the graph can look confusing.

The clustering algorithms add an integer attribute "cluster" to the vertices. This attribute has a unique per-cluster value to indicate which cluster a vertex belongs to, which other algorithms can later use.
