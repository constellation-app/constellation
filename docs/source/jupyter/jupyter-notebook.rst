Jupyter Notebook server
```````````````````````

Selecting Tools â†’ Start Jupyter Notebook will start a Jupyter notebook server. This will in turn automatically open a new page in your default web browser. The HTTP REST server will be started automatically if it hasn't already been started.

The command

``jupyter-notebook``

is used to start the server. This assumes that the command is on your command path. If this command does not work, (for example, you get a "Failed to start jupyter-notebook" error), you may not have installed Jupyter. The easiest way to do this is to install the Anaconda Python distribution.

The notebook server is started in the directory specified by the "Notebook directory" preference.

When the notebook server starts, its output is sent to the output window "Jupyter notebook". If you start a notebook server and the new page contains a "Password or token" prompt, look in the output window for text that looks like this:

.. code-block:: text
  
      Copy/paste this URL into your browser when you connect for the first time,
      to login with a token:
          http://localhost:8888/?token=*7f9658570b3bc41bd04cfb20caa382ab67eee7457c7391dc*
  
Copy/paste the token (shown in the example above as bold text) into the "Password or token" input field and select "Log in". Alternatively, you can use the command ``jupyter notebook list`` at a command prompt to see what notebook servers are running, and use an existing token.

When the notebook server starts, its output is sent to the output window "Jupyter notebook".

When CONSTELLATION exits, it will automatically shut down the Jupyter notebook that it started.

If for some reason CONSTELLATION cannot start a Jupyter notebook server, you can start one manually using the command above at a command prompt. Don't forget to manually start the REST server. You will also have to manually shut down the notebook server.

Starting your own Jupyter notebook

Starting your own Jupyter notebook server by entering the command ``jupyter-notebook`` at a command prompt in the correct directory has exactly the same result. This is just a convenience provided by CONSTELLATION.
