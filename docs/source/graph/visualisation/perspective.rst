Perspective view
----------------

The Perspective view allows you to bookmark a viewing position so you can return to it later. It lets you keep different perspectives on your graph.

To add a perspective bookmark, move to the position you want to save, open the Perspective Bookmarks view, and select "Add a graph-relative perspective". A new bookmark with a default name will be added.

Perspective bookmarks can be renamed and deleted. They will be saved with your graph so you can continue to use them.
