Open Graph
``````````

Used to open a Constellation graph file. The standard menu for opening Constellation files is: *File â†’ Open*

This command presents a dialog for selecting a file. Once the dialog is dismissed, the file is read and the contents displayed in a new graph window.

Constellation graph files are identified by the file suffix *.star*.

Constellation will not allow the user to open a graph file that is already open.

Note: The user may also open a Constellation file by dragging the file over the Constellation interface.
