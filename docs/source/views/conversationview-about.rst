Conversation Viewer
```````````````````

The conversation viewer panel displays the text of the "Content" attribute of transactions selected between two nodes. The content is ordered chronologically by the "DateTime" attribute. If links in both directions are selected then the content is displayed as a conversation. Content is only displayed for selected transactions. If transactions between more than two nodes are selected then no conversation text will be displayed.

The content is displayed in chat "bubbles", similar to those used by some smart phones and instant messaging clients. The text and time stamps can be selected and copied. To copy selected text, press <Control>-C or right click and use the context menu. CONSTELLATION will "beep" if you use <Control>-C but copy the text anyway. When text is selected in a bubble, any text already selected in other bubbles is not automatically deselected however only text in the current bubble is copied.

If translated content is present in the graph, you can choose to view the original content, the translation, or both using the buttons at the top of the window. If you are viewing translations only and a particular transaction does not have a translation, then the original content will be displayed in italics.

You can enable or disable the hover translation capability available for certain languages using the check box at the bottom of the panel. Disabling this will make it easier to select and copy text from the window.
