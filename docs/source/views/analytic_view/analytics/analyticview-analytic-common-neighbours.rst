Common Neighbours
-----------------

Similarity measures are used to determine how many features two entities have in common.

The Common Neighbours analytic calculates the number of common neighbours between two nodes. The Soundarajan-Hopcroft Common Community Neighbours parameter will add a bonus of 1 to the score if both nodes are selected.
