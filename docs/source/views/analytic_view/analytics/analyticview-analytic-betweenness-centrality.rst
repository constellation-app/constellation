Betweenness Centrality
----------------------

In graph theory, centrality is any measure that determines how structurally important a node is within a graph and a shortest path distance between two nodes is path that takes the minimum number of hops. The shortest path between two nodes is typically the most likely route for information to flow through a network.

Betweenness centrality is a measure of importance calculated by determining the shortest path between every pair of nodes on the graph, and then counting the number of shortest paths each node falls on. The more shortest paths a node falls on, the more information it is likely to receive.
