Connectivity Degree
-------------------

In graph theory, a component is a group of nodes that are completely connected and a nodeâ€™s component size is the number of nodes in its component.

The connectivity degree of a node is the number of components that nodes hold together. Deleting the node from the graph will result in a disconnected graph made up of a number of components equal to the connectivity degree.
