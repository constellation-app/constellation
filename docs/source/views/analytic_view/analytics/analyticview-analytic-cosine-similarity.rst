Cosine Similarity
-----------------

Similarity measures are used to determine how many features two entities have in common.

The Cosine Similarity is a measure of the angle between the feature vectors of two nodes. The features used to determine similarity with cosine similarity are a node's neighbours, including the direction, types and weight of the transactions connecting them. A nodeâ€™s features are converted into vectors, (geometric objects defined by a magnitude and a direction), and similarity is then measured by comparing the direction of the vectors of two nodes. Similar vectors will point in similar directions.
