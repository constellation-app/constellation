Pagerank Centrality
-------------------

In graph theory, centrality is any measure that determines how structurally important a node is within a graph.

Pagerank centrality is a measure of a nodeâ€™s importance calculated by counting the number and quality of incoming transactions. The assumption is that important nodes are more likely to receive transactions from other nodes.
