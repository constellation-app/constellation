Degree Centrality
-----------------

In graph theory, centrality is any measure that determines how structurally important a node is within a graph and the degree of a node is a count of its neighbours.

Degree centrality is a measure of a nodeâ€™s importance determined by the number of its neighbours. The more neighbours a node has, the more important it is.
