Katz Centrality
---------------

In graph theory, centrality is any measure that determines how structurally important a node is within a graph.

Katz centrality computes the influence of a node by calculating the number of the neighbours, and other nodes on the graph that connect to the node through these immediate neighbours. Connections made with distant neighbours are penalised by an attenuation factor. It is a variation of eigenvector centrality that incorporates the direction of transactions.
