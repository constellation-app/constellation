Jaccard Index
-------------

Similarity measures are used to determine how many features two entities have in common.

The Jaccard Index is the ratio of common neighbours between two nodes compared to the total number of neighbours of both nodes. The more neighbours two nodes have in common, the more similar they are. The features used to determine similarity with the Jaccard Index are a nodeâ€™s neighbours.
