Eigenvector Centrality
----------------------

In graph theory, centrality is any measure that determines how structurally important a node is within a graph and the degree of a node is a count of its neighbours.

Eigenvector centrality is a measure of a nodeâ€™s importance determined by the number of its neighbours, as well as the average degree of its neighbours. A variation of degree centrality that is less biased towards high degree nodes.
