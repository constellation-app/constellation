Graph Distance
--------------

In graph theory, distance is measured by the number of hops it takes from get from one point to another. The shortest path distance between two nodes is path that takes the minimum number of hops. The eccentricity of a node is the shortest path distance between it and the furthest node. The radius of a graph is the minimum eccentricity. The diameter of a graph is the maximum eccentricity.
