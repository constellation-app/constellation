Paths Layers
------------

The paths layers in the Map View will connect markers together to indicate paths. Paths are rendered using colored lines, with a lighter color indicating the beginning of the path and a darker color representing the end. Lines are offset slightly so that lines in opposite directions are not drawn on top of each other. The thickness of a line can be used to represent a weight.

Entity Paths
````````````

Entity paths represent how nodes on the graph travel between locations. These transactions can be of any type (not just Location). Paths are weighted by the number of times the node travels between the two endpoint locations.

Location Paths
``````````````

Location paths represent paths between location nodes that are directly connected. These transactions can be of any type (not just Location) but must be directed. Paths are weighted by the number of transactions between the two endpoint locations. If the maximum number of transactions in a single direction between locations is greater than the maximum line width, the widths will be scaled to the maximum line width.
