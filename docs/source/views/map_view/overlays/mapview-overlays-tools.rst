Tools Overlay
-------------

The tools overlay displays provides access to some basic tools for interacting with the map.

The *measure tool* allows you to measure a distance on the map. This measurement will be an approximation calculated using the Haversine distance metric. To enable the measure tool, simply click anywhere inside the measure box (a red border will indicate that it is active). Then to use the tool, simply click on the map at the start position, then click again at the end position and the measure box will be updated with the straight line distance. Alternatively, you can hold shift while you click to draw a circle radius, or hold control to draw a complex path.

The *draw tool* allows you to draw custom markers on the map. To enable the draw tool, simply click anywhere inside the draw box (a red border will indicate that it is active). Then to use the tool, simply click anywhere on the map to draw a point marker. Alternatively, you can hold shift while you click to draw a circle marker, or hold control to draw a complex polygon.
