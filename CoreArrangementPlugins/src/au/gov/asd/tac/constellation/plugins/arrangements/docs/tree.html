        <p>
            The tree arrangement arranges all the nodes in tree-like structures with "root" nodes arranged 
            by proximity and then "leaf" nodes placed around their root node circularly. Singleton nodes 
            are arranged together in a grid, similarly for doublets (pairs of nodes only connected to each
            other). The way nodes are placed on the graph will look slightly different each time the 
            arrangement is run.
        </p>
        <p>
            The root nodes are determined by iteratively removing all the nodes with only one neighbour 
            until you are left with a set of nodes where each has more than one neighbour.
