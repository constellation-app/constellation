        <h1>Hierarchical Arrangement</h1>
        <p>
            This arrangement lays out the graph in a per-component tree with specified roots. Each level of the arrangement
            contains nodes at the same distance from the roots, so nodes at level n are n hops from the roots.
            The arrangement ignores transaction directions.
        </p>
        <p>
            To begin, there must be a named selection specifying which nodes are the roots of each component's tree.
            Only one component is required to have a root: if any other components do not have roots in the named selection,
            an arbitrary node will be chosen. If you are unfamiliar with named selections, select the nodes that will be
            the roots of the tree, and press Ctrl-Shift-1. This will create a new named selection called "Selection <em>n</em>",
            which will be visible in the "Named Selections" window.
        </p>
        <p>
            Make sure you deselect the nodes you just selected: if any nodes are selected, then only those nodes will
            be arranged.
        </p>
        <p>
            Run the arrangement. You will be asked for a named selection to specify the roots. Choose the correct named selection
            then OK. The graph will be arranged with the nodes in the named selection at the top.
        </p>
        <p>
            Pendants are a problem. There are often many pendants in a graph, and including them in the tree makes the arrangement
            unwieldy. Therefore pendants are generally not included in the tree. (Strictly, if a node has only a few pendants,
            then those pendants are included.) Pendants are then arranged separately from the tree.
