     * Given a Graph, build a taxonomy by trees. First, the graph will be
     * reduced to a simple graph. Then, each taxon will be a set of vertices
     * such that the subgraph induced from the set is a tree and such that the
     * set contains at most one vertex that was a member of a cycle in the
     * original graph (viewed as undirected). The taxonomy has minimum
     * cardinality satisfying theses properties. The representative of each
     * taxon will the member of the taxon that participated in the cycle, if one
     * existed; else, a random member will be chosen. The edges of each tree are
     * also included in the taxon.
     *
     * The supplied vertexAttributeManger is consulted to set the name of the
     * taxa. Each taxon is given the name of the taxon leader's key.
     *
     * If skipSingletonTaxa is true, does not record taxa that have only one
     * element.
     *
     * @param graph the write lock that will be used to perform the operation.
     * @param skipSingletons should singletons be excluded.
     *
     * @return the graph taxonomy.
