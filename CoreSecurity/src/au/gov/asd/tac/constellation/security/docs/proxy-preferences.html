        <h1>Proxy Preferences</h1>
        <p>
            Proxy preferences can be accessed via Setup -&gt; Options -&gt; CONSTELLATION -&gt; Proxy.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Defining Proxies</h2>
        <p>
            Some plugins use HTTP or HTTPS to access data. The servers that offer resources via these protocols may be reachable
            directly from Constellation, or they may be behind a proxy server. This section allows you to define whether or not a 
            proxy is required to reach a particular server or collection of servers.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are three sections. The last two sections (Additional Proxies and Bypass Proxy) can use hostname suffixes to define 
            a collection of servers. e.g. the suffix ".com" matches hosts with the names "maps.google.com", "facebook.com", and so on.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each name that begins with "." will match any hostname that ends with that name. Each name that does not begin with a "." 
            must match the hostname exactly. All matches are done case-insensitively.
        </p>
        <p>
            Proxies are specified using their hostname and port number, separated by ":".
        </p>
        <p>
            If all sections are empty, then no proxy will be used.
        </p>
        <p>
            NOTE: Any changes to the proxy configuration requires Constellation to be restarted.
        </p>

        <h2>Proxy Selection</h2>
        <p>
            The checkbox "Use Default Settings", when selected, indicates that the built-in defaults are used (the built-in defaults
            may vary depending on the version of Constellation you are using). To specify custom proxy settings, untick this 
            checkbox. When "Use Default Setting" is unticked, a proxy will be determined by looking at each of the following sections 
            in order.
        </p>

        <h2>Local hosts</h2>
        <p>
            This comma-separated list defines hosts and collections of hosts that can be accessed directly. e.g.
        </p>
        <pre>
            .my.org,google.com
        </pre>
        <p>
            This means that all hosts that end with ".my.org" (such as "server.my.org" and "fileshare.my.org", and the specific host 
            "google.com", can be accessed directly.
        </p>
        <p>
            The names "localhost" and "127.0.0.1" are implicitly prepended to the local hosts list.

        <h2>Specific Proxies</h2>
        <p>
            If a hostname does not match the local hosts list,  a specific proxy is looked for. This section contains a list of 
            proxies specific to a name or suffix, one per line. e.g.
        </p>
        <pre>
            .au = au-proxy:8080
            sydney.com = au-proxy:8080
            .com = other-proxy:8888
        </pre>
        <p>
            Any host ending with ".au", and the specific host "sydney.com", will use the proxy "au-proxy", port 8080. Any host ending 
            with ".com" will use the proxy "other-proxy", port 8888.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Default Proxy</h2>
        <p>
            The proxy specified here will be used if a hostname does not match the local hosts list or a specific proxy. e.g. if the 
            exclusion list and the specific list are both empty, and the default proxy is "myproxy:8080", then all hosts will be 
            accessed via the proxy "myproxy" using port 8080.
        </p>
        <p>
            If a default proxy is not specified, then no proxy will be used.
        </p>
