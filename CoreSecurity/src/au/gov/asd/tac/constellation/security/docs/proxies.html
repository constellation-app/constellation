        <h2>Defining Proxies</h2>
        <p>
            Some plugins use HTTP or HTTPS to access data. The servers that offer resources via these protocols may be reachable
            directly from CONSTELLATION, or they may be behind a proxy server. This sections allows you to define whether or not
            a proxy is required to reach a particular server or collection of servers.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are three sections. The first two sections (local hosts and per-suffix proxies) can use hostname suffixes
            to define a collection of servers. For example, the suffix "<span class="mono">.com</span>" matches hosts with
            the names "<span class="mono">maps.google.com</span>", "<span class="mono">facebook.com</span>", and so on.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each name that begins with "." will match any hostname that ends with that name. Each name that does not begin with
            a "." must match the hostname exactly. All matches are done case-insensitively.
        </p>
        <p>
            Proxies are specified using their hostname and port number, separated by ":".
        </p>
        <p>
            If all sections are empty, then no proxy will be used.
        </p>
        <p>
            Note that any changes to the proxy configuration require CONSTELLATION to be restarted.
        </p>

        <h2>Proxy selection</h2>
        <p>
            The checkbox "Use defaults", when selected, indicates that the built-in defaults are used. (The built-in defaults
            may vary depending on the version of CONSTELLATION you are using.)
            To specify custom proxy settings, unselect this checkbox. When "Use defaults" is unselected, a proxy will be determined
            by looking at each of the following sections in order.
        </p>

        <h2>Local hosts</h2>
        <p>
            This comma-separated list defines hosts and collections of hosts that can be accessed directly. For example:
        </p>
        <pre>
            .my.org,google.com
        </pre>
        <p>
            This means that all hosts that end with ".my.org" (such as "server.my.org" and "fileshare.my.org", and the specific
            host "google.com", can be accessed directly.
        </p>
        <p>
            The names "localhost" and "127.0.0.1" are implicitly prepended to the local hosts list.

        <h2>Specific proxies</h2>
        <p>
            if a hostname does not match the local hosts list,  a specific proxy is looked for.
            This section contains a list of proxies specific to a name or suffix, one per line. For example:
        </p>
        <pre>
            .au = au-proxy:8080
            sydney.com = au-proxy:8080
            .com = other-proxy:8888
        </pre>
        <p>
            Any host ending with "<span class="mono">.au</span>", and the specific host
            "<span class="mono">sydney.com</span>", will use the proxy "<span class="mono">au-proxy</span>", port 8080.
            Any host ending with "<span class="mono">.com</span>" will use the proxy
            "<span class="mono">other-proxy</span>", port 8888.
        </p>

        <h2>Default proxy</h2>
        <p>
            The proxy specified here will be used if a hostname does not match the local hosts list or a specific proxy.
            For example, if the exclusion list and the specific list are both empty, and the default proxy is
            "<span class="mono">myproxy:8080</span>", then all hosts will be accessed via the proxy
            "<span class="mono">myproxy</span>" using port 8080.
        </p>
        <p>
            If a default proxy is not specified, then no proxy will be used.
        </p>

        <h2>Print on console</h2>
        <p>
            This option prints debugging text on the CONSTELLATION console. It is useful to see which proxy is being selected
            for a particular host. Generally you won't want to do this.
