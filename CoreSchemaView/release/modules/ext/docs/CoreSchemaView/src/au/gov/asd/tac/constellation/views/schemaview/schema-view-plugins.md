# Plugins

From the Plugins tab of the Schema View, you can view all the plugins
available to users. This is particularly useful for users accessing
Constellation programmatically (e.g. via the REST API). Expanding a
plugin will provide details on the plugin name, alias, and important
details for all associated parameters.

The full list of plugins (and their associated details) can also be
exported to a CSV file via the button in the top right corner of the
tab.
