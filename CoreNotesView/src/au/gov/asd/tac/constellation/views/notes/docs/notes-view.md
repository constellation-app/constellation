## Introduction

The Notes View allows you to annotate on your graph. This is useful for
remembering important pieces of information, and keeping track of what
plugins have been run.

There are two kinds of notes that can be added to the Notes View:

## User-Generated Notes

These are notes which are created by a user and are coloured purple.
These notes are generated by filling the title and note fields located
at the bottom of the Notes View and pressing "Add Note". Both of these
fields need to be filled in otherwise a message will pop-up prompting
you to fill in both fields. If you have the "Link note to graph
selection" option enabled, the note will be applied to all the nodes and
transactions that are selected on the graph (a count of how many of each
will be displayed on the note). If the option is not enabled, or there
is nothing selected on the graph, the note is applied to the entire
graph.

Once added, these notes can edited by pressing the "Edit" button on the
note. When editing, you can edit both the content and the selection that
a note is linked to. A note can be deleted by pressing the "Delete"
button on the note.

You can see which nodes and transactions a user-generated note is linked
to by right-clicking on a note and pressing "Select on Graph". This will
change the graph selection to only the nodes and transactions linked to
that note.

## Auto-Generated Notes

These are notes which are created by Constellation and are coloured
blue. These notes are generated when plugins are executed. Unlike user
generated notes, these notes cannot be edited or removed.

NOTE: Auto generated notes are always created in the background but they
won't be added to the Notes View unless the view is open. If you close
Constellation before it has a chance to add those notes to the Notes
View, those notes will be lost.

## Filters

There are filters available to determine what notes are visible in the
view:

-   *User Notes*: Show all the user-generated notes.
-   *Auto Notes*: Show all the auto-generated notes. When this is
    ticked, an additional filter drop-down is added, allowing you to
    filter on specific types of plugins.
-   *Selected*: Show all the user-generated notes for a given selection
    (including those applied to the entire graph). When this is ticked,
    the User Notes and Auto Notes options are automatically unticked (if
    any of them are ticked). Similarly, if you tick one of the other
    filter options, this option will be automatically unticked.
