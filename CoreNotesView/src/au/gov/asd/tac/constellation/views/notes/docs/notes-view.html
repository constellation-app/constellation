        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
           The Notes View allows you to annotate on your graph. This is useful for remembering important pieces 
           of information, and keeping track of what plugins have been run. 
        </p>
        
        <div style="text-align: center">
            <img src="resources/NotesView.png" alt="Notes View">
        </div>
        
        <p>
            There are two kinds of notes that can be added to the Notes View:           
        </p>
        
        <h2>User Generated Notes</h2>
        <p>
            These are notes which are created by a user and are coloured red. These notes are generated by filling the 
            title and note fields located at the bottom of the Notes View and pressing "Add Note". Both of these fields 
            need to be filled in otherwise a message will pop-up prompting you to fill in both fields. Once added, these 
            notes can edited by pressing the "Edit" button on the note and deleted by pressing the "Delete" button on the
            note.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Auto Generated Notes</h2>
        <p>
            These are notes which are created by Constellation and are coloured blue. These notes are generated when plugins
            are executed. Unlike user generated notes, these notes cannot be edited or removed.
        </p>
        <p>
            NOTE: Auto generated notes are always created in the background but they won't be added to the Notes View unless
            the view is open. If you close Constellation before it has a chance to add those notes to the Notes View, those 
            notes will be lost.
