            The Find View allows the creation of sophisticated rules to be searched for, and 'matched' on a graph. You can choose to 
            find on nodes, transactions, edges, or links.
        </p>

        <div style="text-align: center">
            <img src="resources/FindView.png" alt="Find">
        </div>
        
        <h2>Basic Find</h2>
        <p>
           In the Basic Find tab, you are able to before a basic search on attribute values in your graph. Click on "Select 
           attributes..." to display a drop down list of attributes you can search on and type your search term into the "Find what:" 
           text box. There are options below the text box to interpret your search as standard text or a regular expression (RegEx) 
           and options to make the search case-sensitive or only match the exact search term. You can reset your search by clicking 
           on "Reset to Default".
        </p>
        <p>
            Once you have setup your search, click "Find" to select everything on the graph matching the specified criteria.
        </p>
        <p>
            NOTE: Anything already selected on the graph will be deselected if it is not a part of the result set of the search. If you 
            want to instead append the results to the current selection, tick "Add results to current selection".
        </p>
        
        <h2>Replace</h2>
        <p>
           In the Replace tab, you are able to perform a basic search and replace on attribute values in your graph. The setup is 
           similar to that of the basic find except with an additional "Replace with:" text box to specify the replacement text.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once you have setup your search, click "Replace". This will highlight everything on the graph matching the find text and 
            replace the find text with the replace text.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Advanced Find</h2>
        <p>
            In the Advanced Find tab, you are able to create a series of find rules to be used for your search. At the top of the tab, 
            you can choose a graph element has to match all of the rules or any of them. You can add or remove rules from by clicking 
            on the "+" or "-" located to the left of a rule.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are currently 8 supported attribute types that can be searched for in various ways. Attribute types that are not 
            registered as one of the following types will be searched as 'strings.' The types are as follows:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Boolean searches:<br />
                <img src="resources/find-boolean.png" alt="">
            </li>
            <li>Colour searches:<br />
                <img src="resources/find-color.png" alt="">
            </li>
            <li>Date searches:<br />
                <img src="resources/find-date.png" alt="">
            </li>
            <li>DateTime searches:<br />
                <img src="resources/find-datetime.png" alt="">
            </li>
            <li>Float searches:<br />
                <img src="resources/find-float.png" alt="">
            </li>
            <li>Icon searches:<br />
                <img src="resources/find-icon.png" alt="">
            </li>
            <li>String searches:<br />
                <img src="resources/find-string.png" alt="">
            </li>
            <li>Time searches:<br />
                <img src="resources/find-time.png" alt="">
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Once you have setup your search, click "Find" to select everything on the graph matching any or all (depending on what 
            was selected) of the specified criteria.
