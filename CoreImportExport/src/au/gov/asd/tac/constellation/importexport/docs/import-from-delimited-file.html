        <h1>Import from delimited file</h1>
        <p>
            The "Import from delimited file" window allows you to import data from the following sources:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>file containing comma-separated values (CSV)</li>
            <li>file containing tab-separated values (TSV)</li>
            <li>XML file</li>
            <li>SQLite</li>
            <li>Excel</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>High level workflow steps</h2>
        <p>
            The following is a high level workflow an analyst can follow to get the most out of the import delimited file
            feature follow these high level steps (explained in detail later on):
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Select the import file parser</li>
            <li>Click on the <img src="resources/plus_coloured.png" alt=""> to add files.</li>
            <li>Select your destination graph.</li>
            <li>Drag and drop attributes from the bottom pane onto your columns.</li>
            <li>Right click an attribute for more options.</li>
            <li>Click on the Import button to import the data to your destination graph.</li>
            <li>Save your template using Options -> Save.</li>
            <li>Share the template</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Some use full hints are:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>See all supported attributes using Options -> Show all schema attributes</li>
            <li>Hover over the attribute name for a tooltip.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Adding and removing files to import</h2>
        <p>
            Add files to import using the <img src="resources/plus_coloured.png" alt=""> and remove a file
            using the <img src="resources/minus_coloured.png" alt="">. Once a file has been selected, the
            full name will appear. If the entire file location is not visible, extend the window to see the full name.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once you add a file, the <strong>Configuration</strong> section will display the first 100 rows of the file as a preview.
            The limit of 100 rows is to make the loading of the preview quick so that you can get on with the rest of the
            configuration activities.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you have imported multiple files, selecting the file will update the preview in the <strong>Configuration</strong>
            section.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <strong>Import File Parser</strong> defines the format of the file be it comma-separated (CSV) or tab-separated (TSV)
            values.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <strong>Initialise With Schema</strong> is enabled by default and will be what you want in most scenarios. With this
            option enabled, it will mean that the new nodes and transactions added to the graph will follow the rules
            governed my the schema. For example, if this is not selected then the nodes imported will not have a label, icon
            and other attributes defined.
        </p>

        <h2>Select the destination graph</h2>
        <p>
            Select the destination graph from the drop down list. Note that when selecting the destination, the attributes
            in the configuration pane update depending on what attributes are supported by the schema of that graph.
        </p>

        <h2>Apply Attributes to the data</h2>
        <p>
            Applying an attribute to the column is simple as dragging and dropping an attribute onto a column.
        </p>
        <img src="resources/dragging_attributes.png" alt="">
        <p>
            By default, not all attributes available to the selected schema are visible because there can be an overwhelming number
            of attributes depending on the schema. To see all possible attributes you can apply to a graph go to
            Options -> Show all schema attributes.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you have a specific format for example the DateTime, then you can right click on the DateTime attribute and select
            the format from the drop down list or enter your own.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you want to create your own attributes then you can by clicking on <img src="resources/plus_coloured.png" alt="">
            and selecting a type and entering a label.
        </p>

        <h2>Directed and undirected transactions</h2>
        <p>
            By default, transactions are created as directed. In the Transaction Attributes column there is a pseudo-attribute
            called <span class="mono">__directed__</span> which can be used to create directed and undirected transactions
            as required. The <span class="mono">__directed__</span> pseudo-attribute is a boolean that will cause a
            transaction to be directed when its value is (case-insensitively) "true", and undirected otherwise.
        </p>

        <h2>Importing Data</h2>
        <p>
            Once your configuration is finished, import the entire file with the format you have applied by clicking on the <strong>Import</strong>
            button located at the bottom right hand corner.
        </p>
        <p>
            Note that the import window does not dissappear. This is so that you don't have to re-configure from the beginning. Once you
            are satisfied with the configuration, you have the ability to save your settings explained in the next section.
        </p>

        <h2>Saving and loading import templates</h2>
        <p>
            An import configuration can be saved as a template, and loaded at a later time, using the "Options" menu
            in the top left corner of the window.
        </p>
        <p>
            When a template is saved, the import definition name is used to name the saved query. If a query of that name
            has already been saved, you will be asked if you want to overwrite it. Templates are saved in the directory
            <span class="mono"><em>HOME_DIRECTORY</em>/.CONSTELLATION/ImportDelimited</span>. (The name of the file in which the
            template is saved is encoded so it doesn't clash with file system limitations.) Files in this directory
            can be deleted using your favourite file management utility.
        </p>
        <p>
            Before loading a template, you should select the files you want to import. The loaded template attempts to match
            the column names it knows with the column names in the current files. If a template is loaded before any files
            are selected, there are no columns to match against.
        </p>
        <p>
            When you select "Load...", you will be presented with a list of saved templates. Select one from the list and
            select Ok. The template will be loaded and will appear as it was when it was saved.
        </p>

        <h2>Share templates</h2>
        <p>
            To share the template do the following:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Click on Help -> User Directory</li>
            <li>Navigate to the folder called <strong>ImportDelimited</strong></li>
            <li>Give the appropriate .json file to a recipient</li>
            <li>Upon receiving the file, they can follow these steps to save that .json file inside the <strong>ImportDelimited</strong> directory</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Note that the .json filename should not change!
        </p>
