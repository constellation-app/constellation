 * AttributeData instances hold information about attributes as they exist in a

 * The Attribute Editor maintains a collection of these objects as part of its
 * data model, which is an {@link AttributeState} object. Doing so facilitates
 * operations that only require information about attributes and not their
 * values, such as highlighting schema and key attributes in the editor, or
 * adding and removing attributes on the graph.
 * <br>
 * AttributeData objects are for the most part immutable. When anything about
 * the attribute itself changes, a new AttributeData object should be created.
 * The exception to this is the attribute's modification counter, which only
 * represents a change in the attribute's values. This change may be reflected
 * in the existing AttributeData object by calling
 * {@link #attibuteValueHasChanged attibuteValueHasChanged()}.
