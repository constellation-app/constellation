## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the
[Constellation Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are
expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behaviour to
[stellar.admin@csiro.au](mailto:stellar.admin@csiro.au).

## I don't want to read this whole thing I just have a question!

To start, you can create an issue to ask your question and please be patient
until we respond. In the near future, we will consider using a different forum
like Stack Overflow, Slack, etc.

## What should I know before I get started?

### Constellation Core

This [repository](https://github.com/constellation-app/constellation) is sometimes referred
to as the ***Core*** and can be treated like the framework you develop your
functionality on top of within your own module suite.

The Core should only contain functionality that is ***domain agnostic***.
Functionality that is specific to a domain should be developed in a module that
is in your own module suite.

Note that if some of the functionality you develop can be developed in a domain
agnostic approach then you can contribute that functionality to Core and develop
the domain specific functionality in your own module. Refer to the
[developer guide](https://github.com/constellation-app/constellation-training/blob/master/CONSTELLATION%20Developer%20Guide.pdf)
for information on how this is achieved.

### Constellation Modules and Repositories

The Core is broken up into several modules which are logically grouped into
components based on functionality. Refer to the component diagram below which
depicts how the modules are grouped together:

![Constellation Components](docs/components.png)

The Core was developed with the intention that developers could extend its
functionality by implementing interfaces and using the Service Provider design
pattern.

Constellation's modular design technically provides you the ability to swap out
modules with your own implementation of choice. For instance, you could
replace the `Core Table View` module with your own implementation in your module
and disable `Core Table View` via the `Setup` > `Plugins` > `Installed` option.

However, we would encourage effort be taken to instead improve the existing
views and add extension points to address specific use cases.

Modules developed outside of the Core module suite would exist in their own
module suite and would need to be hosted on a separate repository to Core.

A list of repositories containing modules that can be used by Constellation is
available in the
[Repositories Catalog](CATALOG_OF_REPOSITORIES.md).
If you have created a module suite dependant on Core then feel free to send a
pull request to have your repository included in the catalog.

### Design Decisions

When we make a significant decision in how we maintain the project and what we
can or cannot support, we document the
[design decisions](DESIGN_DECISIONS.md).
If you have a question about how we do things, check if it is documented there.
If it is *not* documented there, please open an
[issue](https://github.com/constellation-app/constellation/issues) and ask your
question.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report for Constellation.
Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your
report, reproduce the behaviour and find related reports.

Before creating bug reports, please check the
[issue tracker](https://github.com/constellation-app/constellation/issues) as it
may already be reported. When you are creating a bug report, please
[include as many details as possible](#how-do-i-submit-a-good-bug-report). Fill
out [the required template](ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md), the information it asks helps us
resolve issues faster.

> **Note:** If you find a **Closed** issue that seems like it is the same problem
you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original
issue in the body of your new issue.

#### Before Submitting A Bug Report

* Check whether the issue has already been reported in the
[issues](https://github.com/constellation-app/constellation/issues) page.
* Double check whether the issue is a bug in this repository or from a module
from [another repository](CATALOG_OF_REPOSITORIES.md) you have installed.

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report?

Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues).
After you've determined [which repository](#constellation--modules-and-packages)
your bug is related to, create an issue on that repository and provide the
following information by filling in [the template](ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md).

Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce
the problem:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
* **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as
possible. For example, start by explaining how you started Constellation, e.g.
which command exactly you used in the terminal, or how you started Constellation
otherwise. When listing steps, **don't just say what you did, but explain how
you did it**. For example, if you created some nodes, did you use the import
delimited file option, via the Rest API, Scripting View, create them using the
edit mode, or another method?
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include links to files
or GitHub projects, or copy/paste snippets, which you use in those examples.
If you're providing snippets in the issue, use
[Markdown code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines).
* **Describe the behaviour you observed after following the steps** and point out
what exactly is the problem with that behaviour.
* **Explain which behaviour you expected to see instead and why.**
* **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** which show you following the
described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem. You can use
[this tool](https://www.cockos.com/licecap) to record GIFs on macOS and Windows,
and [this tool](https://github.com/colinkeenan/silentcast) for Linux.
* **If you're reporting Constellation crashing**, include a stack trace from
the operating system. Include the crash report in the issue in a
[code block](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines),
a [file attachment](https://help.github.com/articles/file-attachments-on-issues-and-pull-requests),
or put it in a [gist](https://gist.github.com) and provide a link to that gist.
* **If the problem is related to performance or memory**, include a profile
file generated via the ***Performance*** toolbar NetBeans button.
* **If the problem is related to graphics**, include the output from `Help` >
`JOGL Version` in a
[code block](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines),
a [file attachment](https://help.github.com/articles/file-attachments-on-issues-and-pull-requests),
or put it in a [gist](https://gist.github.com) and provide a link to that gist.
* **If the problem wasn't triggered by a specific action**, describe what you
were doing before the problem happened and share more information using the
guidelines below.

Provide more context by answering these questions:

* **Did the problem start happening recently** (e.g. after updating to a new
version of Constellation) or was this always a problem?
* If the problem started happening recently, **can you reproduce the problem in
an older version of Constellation?** What's the most recent version in which the
problem doesn't happen? You can download older versions of Constellation from
[the releases page](https://github.com/constellation-app/constellation/releases).
* **Can you reliably reproduce the issue?** If not, provide details about how
often the problem happens and under which conditions it normally happens.

Include details about your configuration and environment (if you don't wish to
provide the Support Package):

* **Which version of Constellation are you using?** You can get the exact
version by looking at the version on the top left of the application title
* **What is the name and version of the OS you are using**?
* **Are you running Constellation in a virtual machine?** If so, which VM
software are you using and which operating systems and versions are used for the
host and the guest?
* **Which [packages](CATALOG_OF_REPOSITORIES.md) do you have installed?** You
can get that list by running `Help` > `Module Versions`.
* **Are you using Constellation with multiple monitors?** If so, can you
reproduce the problem when you use a single monitor?

### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for
Constellation, including completely new features and minor improvements to
existing functionality. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the
community understand your suggestion and find related suggestions.

Before creating enhancement suggestions, please check the
[issue tracker](https://github.com/constellation-app/constellation/issues) as
you might find that you don't need to create one. When you are creating an
enhancement suggestion, please [include as many details as possible](#how-do-i-submit-a-good-enhancement-suggestion).
Fill in [the template](ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md), including the steps you imagine
you would take if the feature you're requesting existed.

#### Before Submitting An Enhancement Suggestion

* Check whether the enhancement has already been reported in the
[issues](https://github.com/constellation-app/constellation/issues) page.
* Double check whether the enhancement is a feature in this repository or from
a module from [another repository](CATALOG_OF_REPOSITORIES.md) you have installed.

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Enhancement Suggestion?

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as
[GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues). After you've
determined [which repository](CATALOG_OF_REPOSITORIES.md) your enhancement
suggestion is related to, create an issue on that repository and provide the
following information:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.
* **Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as much
detail as possible.
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include copy/pasteable
snippets which you use in those examples, as
[Markdown code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines).
* **Describe the current behaviour** and **explain which behaviour you expected to
see instead** and why.
* **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** which show you following the
described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem. You can use
[this tool](https://www.cockos.com/licecap) to record GIFs on macOS and Windows,
and [this tool](https://github.com/colinkeenan/silentcast) on Linux.
* **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to most Constellation users
and isn't something that can or should be implemented as a
[community package](CATALOG_OF_REPOSITORIES.md).
* **List some other applications where this enhancement exists.**
* **Which version of Constellation are you using?** You can get the exact
version by looking at the version on the top left of the application title
* **Specify the name and version of the OS you're using.**

### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to Constellation? You can start by looking
through these `beginner` and `help-wanted` issues:

* [Beginner issues][beginner-issues] - issues which should only require a few lines of
code, and a test or two.
* [Help wanted issues][help-wanted-issues] - issues which should be a bit more involved
than `beginner` issues.

Both issue lists are sorted by total number of comments. While not perfect, the
number of comments is a reasonable proxy for impact a given change will have.

If you want to read about developing modules for Constellation, please make sure
you complete the self-paced
[Constellation Developer Guide](https://github.com/constellation-app/constellation-training/blob/master/CONSTELLATION%20Developer%20Guide.pdf).

#### Local development

Constellation Core and all packages can be developed locally. For instructions
on how to do this, see the ***Build Constellation*** section in the
[Readme](README.md).

* Javadoc classes and methods
* All changes are unit tested
* Include screenshots and animated GIFs in your pull request whenever possible.
* Format your code using the default NetBeans formatter settings. For specifics see the [style guide](STYLE_GUIDELINES.md).
* Ensure that new ***leaks*** or ***code smells*** are not introduced by parsing
you code using `sonar-scanner` and checking via [Sonar Qube](https://sonarcloud.io)
* Document code based on the [style guide](STYLE_GUIDELINES.md)
* Avoid OS dependant code (e.g. Windows or Linux)
* Utility methods should end with the word Utilities (i.e not Util or Utility)
* Update the [change log](CHANGELOG.md) as a means to notify developers or
important improvements or changes
   * You must start with Added, Fixed, Improved, Moved, Removed,
Renamed or Updated and sort them alphabetically
* Update whatsnew.txt if you want to inform users about your change
* Update the html help pages as required
* Use `java.util.logging.Logger` instead of `System.out.println` or
`System.err.println`.
    * Note you should not use `org.apache.log4j.Logger` because it won't
appear in the logs.
* Use StandardCharsets.UTF_8.name() instead of "UTF-8"
* Classes that match `*AttributeDescriptionV*`, `*IOProviderV*` or
`*AttributeUpdateProvider` should be saved in a sub package named
***compatibility***.
    * Classes that match `*AttributeDescriptionV*` or `*IOProviderV*`
should be annotated with `@deprecated`.
* When developing a plugin, the plugin parameters have a label and description.
   * Note that whenever a parameter has a default value, mention it in the
parameters description.
* If your class extends `Plugin.class` and uses the `@ServiceProvider` annotation
then the class name must end with the word `Plugin`.
* Ensure new plugins have been added to the corresponding `*PluginRegistry`.
* If you're calling arrangement plugins from within your plugin, you must add
logic to check whether the freeze graph view state is enabled like so:
    ```java
    if (!CoreUtilities.isGraphViewFrozen()) {
      PluginExecution.withPlugin(ArrangementPluginRegistry.GRID_COMPOSITE).executeNow(wg);
      PluginExecution.withPlugin(CorePluginRegistry.RESET).executeNow(wg);
    } else {
      PluginExecution.withPlugin(CorePluginRegistry.RESET).executeNow(wg);
    }
    ```
* Plugin parameter constants should be built using the following conventions:
    * The constant should end in _PARAMETER_ID.
    * An example of creating a plugin parameter looks like:
    ```java
    public static final String MERGE_TYPE_PARAMETER_ID = PluginParameter.buildId(MergeNodesPlugin.class, "merge_type");
    ```
    * In the `createParameters` method do the following:
    ```java
    final PluginParameter<SingleChoiceParameterValue> mergeType = SingleChoiceParameterType.build(MERGE_TYPE_PARAMETER_ID);
    ```
* If you're using `javafx.stage.Stage` as a dialog, replace it with
`ConstellationDialog` which makes sure your dialog remains on top (i.e is modal aware).
* When documenting use the following conventions:
    * **nodes** rather than **vertices**
    * Use active voice. For example
        * GOOD:
            * *To extract the foo, manipulate the bar*
        * BAD:
            * *The foo can be extracted by manipulating the bar*
    * Give direct instructions (avoid *will* and *if*)
        * GOOD:	
            * *To increase the volume, turn the dial*
            * *Turn the dial to increase the volume*
            * *Turning the dial increases the volume*
        * OK:	
            * *Turning the dial will increase the volume*
        * BAD:	
            * *If you turn the dial, the volume will increase*
    * Exception to rule above:  Use conditional statements for warnings or unlikely events.
        * GOOD:
            * *Clicking the big red button will activate the self-destruct
            * *If you click on the big red button, the self-destruct will activate*
        * OK:		
            * *Click on the big red button to activate the self-destruct*
            * *To activate the self-destruct, click the big red button*
    * **you** rather than **we**
        * GOOD:
            * *You should save your graph before continuing*
        * BAD:	
            * *We recommend saving your graph before continuing*

## Test Requirements for Contributors ###

If you plan to contribute a pull request, you need to ensure your code is
well tested. Please ensure your code has adequate test coverage and
contains both unit and integration tests.

To make sure your changes work as intended and don't break existing
functionality, compile and run the existing Constellation
tests and integration tests.

* To run tests within your module, right click on the module from the Projects
view and select ***Test***.
* To run all tests, right click on the ***CONSTELLATION_CORE*** module suite from
the Projects view and select ***Test***.
* Push your changes to a ***Sonar Qube*** instance and make sure that you're not
introducing new leaks that don't already exist. A good way to check this is to
filter issues by your author name and date range.
