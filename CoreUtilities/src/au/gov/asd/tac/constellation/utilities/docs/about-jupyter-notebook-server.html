        <h1>About The Jupyter Notebook Server</h1>
        
        <p>
            Selecting Tools -&gt; Start Jupyter Notebook will start a Jupyter notebook server. This will in turn automatically open a 
            new page in your default web browser. The HTTP REST server will be started automatically if it hasn't already been 
            started.
        </p>
        <p>
            The command "jupyter-notebook" is used to start the server. This assumes that the command is on your command path. If 
            this command doesn't work (e.g. you get a "Failed to start jupyter-notebook" error), you may not have installed Jupyter. 
            The easiest way to do this is to install the Anaconda Python distribution.
        </p>
        <p>
            The notebook server is started in the directory specified by the "Notebook directory" preference (in Application 
            preferences).
        </p>
        <p>
            When the notebook server starts, its output is sent to the output window "Jupyter notebook". If you start a notebook 
            server and the new page contains a "Password or token" prompt, look in the output window for text that looks like this:
        </p>
        <pre>
    Copy/paste this URL into your browser when you connect for the first time,
    to login with a token:
        http://localhost:8888/?token=7f9658570b3bc41bd04cfb20caa382ab67eee7457c7391dc
        </pre>
        <p>
            Copy/paste the token into the "Password or token" input field and select "Log in". Alternatively, you can use the 
            command "jupyter notebook list" at a command prompt to see what notebook servers are running, and use an existing token.
        </p>
        <p>
            When the notebook server starts, its output is sent to the output window "Jupyter notebook".
        </p>
        <p>
            When Constellation exits, it will automatically shut down the Jupyter notebook that it started.
        </p>
        <p>
            If for some reason Constellation cannot start a Jupyter notebook server, you can start one manually using the command 
            above at a command prompt. Don't forget to manually start the REST server. You will also have to manually shut down the 
            notebook server.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Starting your own Jupyter notebook</h2>
        <p>
            Starting your own Jupyter notebook server by entering the command "jupyter-notebook" at a command prompt in the correct 
            directory has exactly the same result. This is just a convenience provided by Constellation.
