/**
 * A singleton instance of a clipboard for CONSTELLATION that can be used to
 * hold many application specific types of data, most notably a copy of a Graph.
 * <p>
 * We use a local clipboard instance because (a) nothing else knows how to deal
 * with a Graph, and (b) the system clipboard would require the graph to be
 * serialised. Therefore, cut/copy/paste of a graph only works locally.
 * <p>
 * We listen to the system clipboard for ownership loss. The user selecting some
 * text elsewhere overrides the local selection of a graph.
