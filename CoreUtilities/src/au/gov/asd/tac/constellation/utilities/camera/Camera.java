/**
 * This class holds the state of the camera used by the renderer.
 * <p>
 * A Camera is described by four vectors; the 'eye' at which the camera itself
 * is located, the 'centre' at which the camera is focused, the 'up' which
 * points vertically upwards relative to the camera, and the 'rotation' at which
 * the camera will be rotated about if so requested.
 * <p>
 * These camera objects contain these four vectors, as well as previous values
 * of these vectors, information about low and high visibility thresholds (which
 * can be thought of as filters on the lens), information giving the mix between
 * primary and alternate coordinates, and some internal metrics such as a
 * bounding box and a frame which aid in computations.
