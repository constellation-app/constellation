/**
 * A VisualOperation describes an operation to be performed by a
 * {@link VisualProcessor}. They are added to a {@link VisualManager} which will
 * process and forward all received operations in each iteration of its
 * life-cycle.
 * <p>
 * Typically visual operations are created by components trying to inform a
 * {@link VisualProcessor} of visual updates, usually by returning one more
 * {@link VisualChange} objects from their
 * {@link #getVisualChanges getVisualChanges()} method.
 * <p>
 * A {@link VisualProcessor} may also create a number of special purpose
 * operations such as exporting to image or requesting a full refresh refresh.
 * These types of operations typically perform the bulk of their work inside the
 * {@link #apply apply()} method which is called inside the
 * {@link VisualManager} life-cycle immediately before any {@link VisualChange}
 * objects are sent to the processor.
 * <p>
 * Note that if an operation doesn't change any of the data but still needs the
 * processor to enter its update cycle, then
 * {@link #getVisualChanges getVisualChanges()} should return a list containing
 * a single change with the {@link VisualProperty#EXTERNAL_CHANGE} property.
