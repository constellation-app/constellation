/**
 * Visual Change objects describe the change in a single visual property across
 * a data structure (typically a graph).
 * <p>
 * These objects are used by the {@link VisualManager} to relate information
 * about necessary visual updates to a {@link VisualProcessor}. This allows
 * significantly more efficient updating than requiring a
 * {@link VisualProcessor} to listen directly to the data it is visualising.
 * <p>
 * Clients that need to change visual properties of the graph and have a
 * {@link VisualProcessor} respond quickly to them should generate the relevant
 * VisualChange objects, wrap them in {@link VisualOperation} objects, and then
 * queue these operations with the {@link VisualManager}. Otherwise, changes to
 * visual properties will eventually picked up by the
 * {@link GraphChangeDetector}, but this is far too slow for some applications,
 * such as event handling. Creation of VisualChange objects is achieved via a
 * {@link VisualChangeBuilder} rather than through a constructor directly.
 * <p>
 * A VisualChange contains a single {@link VisualProperty} which has changed, an
 * id for de-duplication (when two changes stem from the one logical operation
 * and only one need be recognised), and either a size of the number of changed
 * items, or an explicit integer array of the items that have changed.
 * <p>
 * From the perspective of a {@link VisualProcessor} consuming VisualChange
 * objects, the typical pattern is to loop over the changed elements as follows:
 * <pre>
 * for (int i = 0; i &lt; change.getSize(); i++) {
 *     int changedIndex = change.getElement(i);
 *     // do something with changedIndex
 * }
 * </pre>
