        <h1>Decorators</h1>
        
        <p>
            Decorators are small icons that are displayed in the corners of a node's main icon. They can 
            provide extra information about a node such as showing the flag of a country, or marking a 
            node as good or bad. When they are enabled, decorators are displayed on all nodes in the 
            graph. Decorators use the same icons as the node, so any icon displayed by a node can be used 
            as a decorator.
        </p>
        <p>
            To add a decorator to a node, open the Attribute Editor and edit the "decorators" graph 
            attribute. The resulting dialog allows you to select a node attribute to decorate with its 
            value for each of the four corners of the main icon.
        </p>
        <p>
            NOTE: A decorator will only be displayed on a node if there exists an icon whose name or alias 
            matches the attribute value. If no such icon exists, no decorator will be displayed.
