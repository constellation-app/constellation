        <h2>Jupyter Notebook server</h2>
        <p>
            Selecting Tools &rarr; Start Jupyter Notebook will start a Jupyter notebook server.
            This will in turn automatically open a new page in your default web browser.
            The HTTP REST server will be started automatically if it hasn't already been started.
        </p>
        <p>
            The command
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="mono">jupyter-notebook</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            is used to start the server. This assumes that the command is on your command path. If this command does not work,
            (for example, you get a "Failed to start jupyter-notebook" error), you may not have installed Jupyter. The easiest
            way to do this is to install the Anaconda Python distribution.
        </p>
        <p>
            The notebook server is started in the directory specified by the "Notebook directory" preference.
        </p>
        <p>
            When the notebook server starts, its output is sent to the output window "Jupyter notebook".
            If you start a notebook server and the new page contains a "Password or token" prompt, look in the output window
            for text that looks like this:
        </p>
        <pre>
    Copy/paste this URL into your browser when you connect for the first time,
    to login with a token:
        http://localhost:8888/?token=<strong>7f9658570b3bc41bd04cfb20caa382ab67eee7457c7391dc</strong>
        </pre>
        <p>
            Copy/paste the token (shown in the example above as bold text) into the "Password or token" input field
            and select "Log in". Alternatively, you can use the command <span class="mono">jupyter notebook list</span>
            at a command prompt to see what notebook servers are running, and use an existing token.
        </p>
        <p>
            When the notebook server starts, its output is sent to the output window "Jupyter notebook".
        </p>
        <p>
            When CONSTELLATION exits, it will automatically shut down the Jupyter notebook that it started.
        </p>
        <p>
            If for some reason CONSTELLATION cannot start a Jupyter notebook server, you can start one manually using the
            command above at a command prompt. Don't forget to manually start the
            REST server. You will also have to manually shut down the notebook server.
        </p>
        <h2>Starting your own Jupyter notebook</h2>
        <p>
            Starting your own Jupyter notebook server by entering the command <span class="mono">jupyter-notebook</span> at a
            command prompt in the correct directory has exactly the same result. This is just a convenience provided by
            CONSTELLATION.
