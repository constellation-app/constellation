        <h2>The CONSTELLATION REST server</h2>
        <p>
            The CONSTELLATION REST server offers a RESTful HTTP programming interface to interact with the current graph.
            The API is documented using Swagger; see Tools &rarr; Display REST Server Documentation.
        </p>
        <p>
            The server must be started manually; use Tools &rarr; Start REST Server. The server listens for HTTP
            requests on localhost: this cannot be changed. The listen port can be changed in the application options.
        </p>
        <p>
            When the server starts, it writes a JSON document to a file called <span class="mono">rest.json</span> in your
            <span class="mono">.CONSTELLATION</span> directory. This JSON document records the port that the server is listening on
            (the "port" key) and a secret to be used when communicating with the server (the "X-CONSTELLATION-SECRET" key).
            This secret must be used in the "X-CONSTELLATION-SECRET" HTTP header; requests that do not include the header with the
            secret will be rejected. This stops other clients on the same system from using your REST server to interact with
            your graphs.
        </p>
        <p>
            When started, the server also optionally writes a Python file called <span class="mono">constellation_client.py</span> to
            your <span class="mono">~/.ipython</span> directory. This provides a convenient interface to the REST API for Python
            scripts in Jupyter notebooks. Python 3.6 is required.
        </p>
        <p>
            See the built-in help documentation in the script for details.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Python client library reads the <span class="mono">rest.json</span> document and uses it to communicate with the
            REST server: client code that uses <span class="mono">constellation_client</span> does not need to worry about the details.
        </p>
        <p>
            If downloading is enabled in the options, the Python script file will be downloaded if:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The script file does not already exist; or</li>
            <li>The script file exists, but is different to the latest version known to CONSTELLATION.
        </ul>
        <p>
            This means that when the script is updated, the new version will automatically overwrite an existing version
            the next time the REST server is started.
        </p>

        <h2>Alternate transports</h2>
        <p>
            REST over HTTP works nicely when CONSTELLATION and the client are running on the same workstation. However, this may
            not always be the case. For example, a notebook running under Apache Zeppelin or JupyterLab on a separate server may
            want to communicate with CONSTELLATION.
        </p>
        <p>
            To allow for this scenario, CONSTELLATION also provides a filesystem transport. As well as an HTTP server,
            CONSTELLATION has a file listener which polls a directory. An HTTP
            request is emulated by placing the files <span class="mono">request.json</span> and <span class="mono">content.in</span>
            in this directory; the response is emulated by placing the files <span class="mono">response.json</span> and
            <span class="mono">content.out</span> in the directory.
        </p>
        <p>
            The file listener can be started and stopped using Tools &rarr; Start/Stop File Listener. Starting the file listener
            will also write <span class="mono">constellation_client.py</span> to the <span class="mono">~/.ipython</span> directory.
        </p>
        <p>
            CONSTELLATION polls the directory waiting for the request files to appear. The client places the files in the
            directory, and polls waiting for the response files to appear. When CONSTELLATION sees the request files, it reads
            and deletes them (to avoid confusion with the next request) performs the required action, and writes the response
            files. When the client sees the response files, it reads and deletes them (to avoid further confusion).
        </p>
        <p>
            Polling is initially done once per second. Over time, if no requests are made, the polling period increases to
            once per five seconds, to decrease resource usage on the filesystem. If a request is found, the polling time is reset
            to once per second.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <span class="mono">constellation_client.py</span> client provides two ways of getting the files into the directory
            and retrieving the response.
        </p>
        <dl>
            <dt>Shared filesystem</dt>
            <dd>
                If the CONSTELLATION workstation and the system on which the client is running share the user's filesystem,
                the client can simply create and read files in the user's directory. This method is secure as long as the user's
                filesystem is secure.
            </dd>
            <dt>sftp</dt>
            <dd>
                If the CONSTELLATION workstation and the system on which the client is running do not share a filesystem, the
                client can use sftp to transfer files to and from the CONSTELLATION workstation. This method is as secure as sftp.
            </dd>
        </dl>
        <p>
            See <span class="mono">constellation_client.py</span> for the details of how the filesystem transport is implemented.
