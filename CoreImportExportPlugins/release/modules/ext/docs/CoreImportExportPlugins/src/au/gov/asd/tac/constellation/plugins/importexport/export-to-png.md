# Export Graph Visualisation to Image
[More export options...](../ext/docs/CoreImportExportPlugins/src/au/gov/asd/tac/constellation/plugins/importexport/export-from-constellation.md)

This plugin exports Graphs to a PNG file format that represents the graph as viewed from the interactive graph window. 

A PNG file is a form of raster image file referred to as a “Portable Network Graphics” file. It is a typical image file that supports a broad spectrum of color, transparency and compression without compromising image quality. 

Users are only prompted to select a file save location. No further export options are available.

Please note that this export is currently non performant and will result in a low-quality image that may not accurately reflect the Constellation graph as viewed from the interactive graph window.
