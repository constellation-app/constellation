## Vision Statement

Constellation is a first class, domain agnostic data visualisation and analysis 
application enabling the user to solve large and complex data problems in a 
simple and intuitive way.

* ***Users***: data analysts, data scientists, and all people interested in 
graph data analysis.
* ***Data analysis domains***: graph datasets with rich feature data e.g. social 
networks, network infrastructure, chemical composition, etc.

## Prerequisites

* Constellation is known to work on Windows 64-bit and Linux 64-bit. There is 
currently no support for Mac and the feature request is tracked by 
[Issue #21](https://github.com/constellation-app/constellation/issues/21).
* The OpenGL graph display works with NVIDIA and ATI graphics cards that support
OpenGL 3.3 or later. It is known to not work with Intel on-board graphics cards.

## Download Constellation

Download Constellation by going to the [release page](https://github.com/constellation-app/constellation/releases).

## Run Constellation

Unzip the constellation.zip bundle and double click the `bin/constellation64.exe` 
for Windows or run the `bin\constellation` shell script for Linux.

There is currently no support for Mac and the feature request is tracked by 
[Issue #21](https://github.com/constellation-app/constellation/issues/21).

## Build Constellation

* Constellation requires at least Open JDK 8 with JFX 8 support build to be 
installed and is known to work on Windows 64-bit and Linux 64-bit.

To build Constellation from source code do the following:

* Download NetBeans 8.2 (https://netbeans.org/downloads/old/8.2)
* Download the Open JDK 8 with JFX 8 from Azul website for 
[Windows 64 bit build](https://cdn.azul.com/zulu/bin/zulu8.38.0.13-ca-fx-jdk8.0.212-win_x64.zip) 
or [Linux 64 bit build](https://cdn.azul.com/zulu/bin/zulu8.38.0.13-ca-fx-jdk8.0.212-linux_x64.tar.gz)
* Clone this repository
* Update the `netbeans_jdkhome` variable in `netbeans.conf`. Hint: This file may 
be located at `C:\Program Files\NetBeans 8.2\etc`.
* Open the Constellation_Core module suite from NetBeans
* In the Projects view, expand `Important Files` > `Build Script` > Right click > 
`Update dependencies and clean build`
* Right click > `Run`

## Package Constellation

To package Constellation in a zip bundle do the following:

* In NetBeans, expand `Constellation_Core` > `Important Files`
* Right click on `Build Script` and run the `build-zip-with-windows-jre` or 
`build-zip-with-linux-jre` target

The packaged file should be available from the `dist` directory.

## Common Troubleshooting Checks

* You can check whether your graphics card is supported by following these steps:

1. Click on `File` > `New Graph` to create a graph
1. Click on `Experimental` > `Build Graph` > `Sphere Graph` to create a random graph.
1. If you can see a graph try to interact with it using the mouse.
1. If the graph view remains blank, you may not have a supported graphics card.

* Click on `Help` > `JOGL Version` to see the graphics card capabilities of your machine.
* Click on `Help` > `Show Logs` to view Constellation log information.
