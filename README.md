Constellation is a graph-focused data visualisation and interactive analysis 
application enabling data access, federation and manipulation capabilities 
across large and complex data sets.

## Vision Statement

Constellation is a first class, domain agnostic data visualisation and analysis 
application enabling the user to solve large and complex data problems in a 
simple and intuitive way.

* ***Users***: data analysts, data scientists, and all people interested in 
graph data analysis.
* ***Data analysis domains***: graph datasets with rich feature data e.g. social 
networks, network infrastructure, chemical composition, etc.

## Prerequisites

* Constellation is known to work on Windows 64-bit and Linux 64-bit. There is 
currently no support for Mac and the feature request is tracked by 
[Issue #21](https://github.com/constellation-app/constellation/issues/21).
* The OpenGL graph display works with NVIDIA and ATI graphics cards that support
OpenGL 3.3 or later. It is known to not work with Intel on-board graphics cards.

## Download Constellation

Download Constellation by going to the [release page](https://github.com/constellation-app/constellation/releases).

## Run Constellation

Unzip the constellation.zip bundle and double click the `bin/constellation64.exe` 
for Windows or run the `bin\constellation` shell script for Linux and MacOSX.

## Build Constellation

To build Constellation from source code do the following:

* Download Azul's Zulu distribution of JDK 11 with JFX 11, either the 
[Windows 64 bit](https://cdn.azul.com/zulu/bin/zulu11.37.19-ca-fx-jdk11.0.6-win_x64.zip),
[Linux 64 bit](https://cdn.azul.com/zulu/bin/zulu11.37.19-ca-fx-jdk11.0.6-linux_x64.tar.gz)
or [MacOSX 64 bit](https://cdn.azul.com/zulu/bin/zulu11.37.19-ca-fx-jdk11.0.6-macosx_x64.tar.gz)

* Download [NetBeans 11.3](https://netbeans.apache.org/download/nb113/nb113.html)
* Update `netbeans_jdkhome` in netbeans.conf to point to the Azul Zulu JDK you downloaded (e.g. `C:\Program Files\NetBeans-11.3\netbeans\etc`)
* NetBeans 11 have dropped support for the Java Help system but is still required by Constellation. Until we find a solution to #15 there are 2 jar files that have to be manually copied into the NetBeans installation folder.
  * Download [org-netbeans-modules-javahelp.jar](https://github.com/constellation-app/third-party-dependencies/blob/master/NetBeans%20Help/org-netbeans-modules-javahelp.jar?raw=true) to `C:\Program Files\NetBeans 11.3\platform\modules` (using Windows as an example). Note that you will need to override this file when prompted.
  * Download [jhall-2.0_05.jar](https://github.com/constellation-app/third-party-dependencies/blob/master/NetBeans%20Help/jhall-2.0_05.jar?raw=true) to `C:\Program Files\NetBeans 11.3\netbeans\platform\modules\ext` (using Windows as an example)
* Clone this repository
* Open the Constellation module suite from NetBeans
* In the Projects view, expand `Important Files` > `Build Script` > Right click > 
`Update dependencies and clean build`. This can take around 20 minutes to download the first time so go get a :coffee: and come back later.
* Start Constellation by right clicking on `Constellation` > `Run`

## Package Constellation

To package Constellation in a zip bundle do the following:

* In NetBeans, expand `Constellation` > `Important Files`
* Right click on `Build Script` and run the `build-zip-with-windows-jre` or 
`build-zip-with-linux-jre`

The packaged file should be available from the `dist` directory.

## Common Troubleshooting Checks

* You can check whether your graphics card is supported by following these steps:

1. Click on `File` > `New Graph` to create a graph
1. Click on `Experimental` > `Build Graph` > `Sphere Graph` to create a random graph.
1. If you can see a graph try to interact with it using the mouse.
1. If the graph view remains blank, you may not have a supported graphics card.

* Click on `Help` > `JOGL Version` to see the graphics card capabilities of your machine.
* Click on `Help` > `Show Logs` to view Constellation log information.
