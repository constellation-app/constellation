        <h1>Label Fonts Preferences</h1>
        <p>
            Label fonts preferences can be accessed via Setup -&gt; Options -&gt; CONSTELLATION -&gt; Label Fonts.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            The Label Fonts panel lets you configure the fonts used to draw node labels. This help describes label drawing when the 
            "Use Multiple Font Labels" box is checked.
        </p>
        <p>
            Constellation uses the fonts installed on your workstation to draw node and connection labels on graphs. More than one 
            font can be used, depending on the text being displayed. To render a label, Constellation uses the following steps:
        </p>

        <h3>Divide The Text Into Runs Of A Single Direction.</h3>
        <p>
            English text is read left-to-right. However, other text (such as Arabic and Hebrew) is read right-to-left. The text is 
            scanned to see which direction it belongs to, and split into runs, such that each run contains text of a single direction.
        </p>
        <p>
            NOTE: The Unicode bidirectional algorithm is not used to determine direction. Because the context is Constellation labels 
            rather than general text, a much simpler algorithm is used.
        </p>

        <h3>Divide The Direction Runs Into Runs Of A Single Font.</h3>
        <p>
            Text that runs in a single direction can require more than one font to be rendered. e.g. text that consists of an 
            English word followed by a Chinese word is entirely left-to-right, but the font used to draw the English text may not 
            contain any Chinese characters. If this is the case, and assuming the correct fonts are available, the text will be split 
            into two runs: one for each font.
        </p>

        <h3>Type Placement</h3>
        <p>
            If there is more than one run, and the final run is left-to-right and ends with a type (that is, ends with "&lt;...&gt;"), 
            the text of the type is moved to the beginning of the text.
        </p>

        <h2>Font Selection</h2>
        <p>
            Use the Label Fonts text area in preferences to specify fonts, one per line, with more specific fonts first. Blank lines 
            and lines beginning with "#" are ignored.The menus below the text area contain the available options. Fonts can be 
            specified using either their font name, or the name of the file containing the font. OpenType font files (.otf) and some 
            TrueType font files (.ttf) must be specified using the filename.
        </p>
        <p>
            On Windows, if an OTF font file name such as "NotoSerifSC-Regular.otf" is specified, the file will first be looked for in 
            the user's local profile font directory %LOCALAPPDATA%/Microsoft/Windows/Fonts/NotoSerifSC-Regular.otf, then the windows 
            directory %WINDIR%/Fonts/NotoSerifSC-Regular.otf.
        </p>
        <p>
            An absolute filename (C:/MyFonts/font1.ttf or /fonts/font1.ttf) can be used to specify a font file.
        </p>
        <p>
            An example:
        </p>
        <pre>
            Courier New
            Noto Sans Arabic
            C:\Users\User1\Downloads\Fonts\NotoSerifCJKtc-Regular.otf
        </pre>
        <p>
            This configuration first attempts to use the installed font "Courier New", then the installed font "Noto Sans Arabic", 
            and finally the font in the file C:\Users\User1\Downloads\Fonts\NotoSerifCJKtc-Regular.otf.
        </p>

        <h3>Font Tags</h3>
        <p>
            Fonts can be tagged with additional information. Adding one of the tags "BOLD", "ITALIC", or "BOLD_ITALIC" will have the
            corresponding effect on the font.
        </p>
        <pre>
            Courier New,BOLD
            Noto Sans Arabic
            C:\Users\User1\Downloads\Fonts\NotoSerifCJKtc-Regular.otf
        </pre>
        <p>
            This configuration is the same as the previous one, but uses "Courier New Bold".
        </p>

        <h3>Script Tags</h3>
        <p>
            Each Unicode codepoint has an associated script: for example, English uses Latin script, and Russian uses Cyrillic 
            script.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Arial font contains both Latin and Arabic script, but you may want use Arial for Latin characters, and a different 
            font (say, Noto Sans Arabic) for Arabic characters. You can do this by tagging a font with the scripts it should use or 
            not use.
        </p>
        <pre>
            Arial,LATIN,COMMON
            Noto Sans Arabic
            C:\Users\User1\Downloads\Fonts\NotoSerifCJKtc-Regular.otf
        </pre>
        <p>
            This configuration specifies that Arial will be used only for LATIN (ABC...) and COMMON (punctuation and other symbols) 
            codepoints. This excludes Arabic codepoints, which will therefore be drawn using Noto Sans Arabic.
        </p>
        <pre>
            Arial,BOLD,!ARABIC
            Noto Sans Arabic
            C:\Users\User1\Downloads\Fonts\NotoSerifCJKtc-Regular.otf
        </pre>
        <p>
            This is an alternative to the previous configuration: the "!" signifies a negation, so Arial Bold will not be used for 
            Arabic codepoints, which will therefore be drawn using Noto Sans Arabic.
        </p>

        <h2>Fallback Font</h2>
        <p>
            Regardless of the fonts that are specified, Constellation appends the Java font "SansSerif" to the font list. (On Windows 
            this is typically Arial combined with some other fonts.) Even if the list is empty, or the fonts in the list cannot 
            display all of the codepoints required for labels, Constellation will always attempt to use "SansSerif". This does not 
            guarantee that all codepoints can be displayed.
        </p>

        <h2>Validation</h2>
        <p>
            To ensure that your font configuration is correct, use the Validate button. A message will describe the problem if the 
            configuration is incorrect.
