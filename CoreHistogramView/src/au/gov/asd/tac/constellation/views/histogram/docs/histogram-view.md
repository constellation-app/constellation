## Introduction

The Histogram View provides a way to summarise both the structural
properties of a graph and the values of attributes, as well as the
capability to filter and make selections based on these properties.

View" />

## Histogram Panel

The Histogram Panel displays an interactive summary of information on
the graph in a visual bar chart. The "Property Value" column is a list
of unique values for a particular property, and the "Count" column
displays the number of graph elements which share that property value.

The bar length indicates the proportion of elements that share that
property when compared to the value that is most prevalent on the graph.
It is blue for unselected elements, and red for selected elements. When
only a portion of the elements sharing a property value are selected on
the graph, the count value will also change to the ratio of selected
elements / total elements sharing that property value. It will also be
colored both red and blue, with the proportion of red matching the
ratio of selected / unselected.

Left clicking on a row in the Histogram Panel will select all elements
on the graph which share that Property Value. Holding left click and
dragging across multiple rows will select multiple rows. Holding the
shift key while left clicking will add the clicked row elements to the
selection. Holding the ctrl key while left clicking will toggle the
selection of the clicked row elements.

Right clicking on a row in the Histogram Panel will open up a context
menu allowing you to copy selected property values (and optionally their
counts) to the clipboard.

## Graph Element Buttons

The Graph Element Buttons will toggle which graph elements the Histogram
View will list. Options include Node, Transaction, Edge, and Link.

NOTE: Edges and Links in Constellation do not have Attributes.

## Category Drop Down List

The Category Drop Down List will display categories of properties to
display in the Histogram View. Depending on the Graph Element type, this
list will change.

## Property Drop Down List

The Property Drop Down List will display properties to histogram. The
properties listed will change depending on the Graph Element and
Category selected - see above.

The Format Drop Down List will provide different ways of grouping values
for properties, depending on the type.

-   *String* - Allows for grouping by substring, case (upper or lower)
    and find (which accepts regular expressions).
-   *Numeric* - Allows for binning into buckets of values.
-   *DateTime* - Allows for grouping by various DateTime formats - Hour
    of Day, Day of Week, Month of Year, Date, Year, and so on.
-   *Schema Type* - Allows for grouping by Top-Level Schema Types

## Sort Drop Down List

The Sort Drop Down List will display options for sorting the rows of the
Histogram.

The Arrow Button will toggle Ascending/Descending values.

-   *Label (Number)* - Will sort the rows of the Histogram numerically by
    Property Value label.
-   *Label (Text)* - Will sort the rows of the Histogram alphabetically by
    Property Value label.
-   *Total Count* - Will sort the rows of the Histogram in order of
    Count values.
-   *Selected Count* - Will sort the rows of the Histogram in order of
    the number of elements sharing a Property Value that are selected.
-   *Selected Proportion* - Will sort the rows of the Histogram in order
    of the proportion of elements sharing a Property Value that are
    selected.

## Selection Mode Drop Down List

The Selection Mode will toggle the interactivity of the Histogram View.

-   *Free Selection* - The default setting. Clicking rows which change
    the selection on the graph. Left clicking on a row in the Histogram
    Panel will select all elements on the graph which share that
    Property Value. Holding left click and dragging across multiple rows
    will select multiple rows. Holding the shift key while left clicking
    will add the clicked row elements to the selection. Holding the ctrl
    key while left clicking will toggle the selection of the clicked row
    elements.
-   *Within Existing Selection* - Clicking rows will not change the
    selection on the graph until the adjacent "Select" button is
    pressed. This mode will allow for filtering on the existing graph
    selection. Clicking on a row with selected (red) elements will
    change their color to yellow. Pressing the adjacent "Select" button
    will change the selection on the graph to all yellow elements.
    Holding the shift key while left clicking will change red elements
    of rows to yellow. Holding the ctrl key while left clicking will
    toggle elements of rows between red and yellow.

    Selection
    example" />

-   *Add To Existing Selection* - Clicking rows will not change the
    selection on the graph until the adjacent "Select" button is
    pressed. This mode will allow for adding rows to the existing graph
    selection. Clicking on a row with unselected (blue) elements will
    change their color to yellow. Pressing the adjacent **Select**
    button will change the selection on the graph to all yellow
    elements. Holding the shift key while left clicking will change blue
    elements of rows to yellow. Holding the ctrl key while left clicking
    will toggle elements of rows between blue and yellow.

    Existing Selection

## Filter

<img src="../constellation/CoreHistogramView/src/au/gov/asd/tac/constellation/views/histogram/docs/resources/Histogram-Filter.png" />

The Filter on Selection button will hide unselected elements from the
Histogram View, until such time as the Clear Filter Button is pressed.
The Clear Filter Button will activate only when a Histogram filter is in
place, and as such is useful to check when elements are missing from the
Histogram View.

## Actions

Pressing the Actions button will reveal two options: Save Bins To Graph
and Save Bins To Clipboard

-   *Save Bins to Graph* - Will add a histogram_bin attribute to the
    graph, and the value of which corresponding to the Property Value of
    the node or transaction.
-   *Save Bins to Clipboard* - Will copy the Property Values and Counts
    displayed in the Histogram View to the clipboard, which can be
    pasted into a text editor in a tab delimited format.
-   *Decrease Height of Each Bin* - Decreases the height of the bar for each 
    Count bin.
-   *Increase Height of Each Bin* - Increases the height of the bar for each 
    Count bin.
