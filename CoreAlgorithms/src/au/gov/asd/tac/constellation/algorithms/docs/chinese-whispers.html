            Intuitively, the algorithm works as follows in a
            bottom-up fashion: First all nodes get different
            classes. Then the nodes are processed for a small
            number of iterations and inherit the strongest class
            in the local neighborhood. This is the class whose
            sum of edge weights to the current node is
            maximal. In case of multiple strongest classes, one
            is chosen randomly. Regions of the same class
            stabilize during the iteration and grow until they
            reach the border of a stable region of another class.
            Note that classes are updated immediately: a node
            can obtain classes from the neighborhood that were
            introduced there in the same iteration.

        <pre>
            initialize:
            for all v<sub>i</sub> in V:
              class(v<sub>i</sub>) = i
            while changes:
              for all v in V, randomized order:
                class(v) = highest ranked class in neighborhood of v;
        </pre>
        <p>
            Apart from ties, the classes usually do not
            change any more after a handful of iterations. The
            number of iterations depends on the diameter of
            the graph: the larger the distance between two
            nodes is, the more iterations it takes to percolate
            information from one to another.

            Chinese Whispers in CONSTELLATION makes use of overlay colors.
            When the clustering algorithm has been run, each cluster is assigned a
            unique color. Node backgrounds and intra-cluster transactions are colored
            using the cluster's color, while inter-cluster transactions are colored
            dark grey.
        </p>
        <p>
            Rather than set the color directly, Chinese Whispers in CONSTELLATION creates
            a new color attribute and tells Constellation to display the graph using
            the new attribute. To switch back to the default color attribute, use
            Edit &rarr; Color attribute selection.
        </p>
        <p>
            When the clustering algorithm runs, no arrangement is done, so the graph can look confusing.
        </p>
        <p>
            The clustering algorithms add an integer attribute "cluster" to the vertices.
            This attribute has a unique per-cluster value to indicate which cluster a
            vertex belongs to, which other algorithms can later use.
