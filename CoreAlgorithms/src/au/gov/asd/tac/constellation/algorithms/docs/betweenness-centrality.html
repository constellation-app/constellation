        <p>
            Betweenness Centrality is determined by counting all of the shortest paths within a network that pass through a 
            specific node - the more shortest paths they fall on, the higher their importance. This means it is useful for 
            discovering persons of influence and collaborators, not necessarily leaders (e.g. chiefs of staff, couriers, PAs, 
            advisers, etc.).
