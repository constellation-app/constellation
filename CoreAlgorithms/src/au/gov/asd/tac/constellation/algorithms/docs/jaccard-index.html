        <p>
            Jaccard Index, in general, is used to determine how similar two sets are based on difference between their intersection and their union. 
            For a graph, these sets are composed of the neighbours of each node, resulting in a high similarity score being assigned to any pair of 
            nodes which are connected to similar neighbours.
