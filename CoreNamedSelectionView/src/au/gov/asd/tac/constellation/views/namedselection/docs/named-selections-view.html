        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Named Selections are collections of graph elements that have been saved for later use. Named Selections can be used 
            analytically through their use in union (binary OR) and intersection (binary AND) operations.
        </p>
        
        <div style="text-align: center">
            <img src="resources/namedselections.png" alt="Named Selections">
        </div>

        <h2>Creating and Using Named Selections</h2>
        <p>
            There are two main ways to create and use Named Selections: Through the Named Selection Window, and through the use of 
            shortcut keys.
        </p>
        <p>
            To create a Named Selection with a shortcut key, hold Ctrl-Shift and press one of the numbers from 1-9. To recall a 
            Named Selection with a shortcut key, hold Ctrl and press the corresponding number from 1-9 that was used when creating 
            the Named Selection. The combination to recall a Named Selection is shown next to the selection in the Named Selection 
            Window.
        </p>

        <h2>Performing Unions (OR)</h2>
        <p>
            To perform a union (binary OR) operation, select two or more selections from the Named Selections Window, and press the 
            "Union" button. This will result in all elements from each Named Selection (and the graph if 
            <em>&lt;Current Selection&gt;</em> has been selected) being selected on the graph.
        </p>

        <h2>Performing Intersections (AND)</h2>
        <p>
            To perform an intersection (binary AND) operation, select two or more selections from the Named Selections Window, and 
            press the "Intersection" button. This will result in all common elements from each Named Selection (and the graph if 
            <em>&lt;Current Selection&gt;</em> has been selected) being selected on the graph, and all other elements being 
            unselected.
        </p>

        <h2>Advanced Use of Named Selections</h2>
        
        <div style="text-align: center">
            <img src="resources/namedselection-context.png" alt="">
        </div>
        
        <h3>Protecting Selections</h3>
        <p>
            To ensure a selection is not inadvertently deleted, it can be protected. This can be achieved by right clicking the 
            relevant Named Selection, and selecting the "Protect Selection" menu item. A small padlock appears next to protected 
            Named Selections to indicate this mode.
        </p>

        <h3>Cloning Selections</h3>
        <p>
            To create a duplicate of a Named Selection, right click it and select "Clone Selection" from the menu. This will create 
            a new named selection that contains all of the elements that the original Named Selection contained.
        </p>

        <h3>Renaming Selections</h3>
        <p>
            Named Selections can be given meaningful names by highlighting the selection in the Named Selection Window and pressing 
            F2, or right-clicking and selecting "Rename Selection". A prompt is shown where a new name can be entered.
        </p>

        <h3>Setting Selection Descriptions</h3>
        <p>
            Descriptions for Named Selections can be set by right-clicking a Named Selection, and selecting "Set Selection 
            Description" from the menu. A prompt is shown where a description can be entered. If a Named Selection has had a 
            description appended, it will be placed in a tooltip if the mouse is hovered over the Named Selection for a short 
            period of time.
