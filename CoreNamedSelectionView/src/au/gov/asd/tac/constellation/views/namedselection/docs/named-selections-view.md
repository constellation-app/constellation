## Introduction

Named Selections are collections of graph elements that have been saved
for later use. Named Selections can be used analytically through their
use in union (binary OR) and intersection (binary AND) operations.

## Creating and Using Named Selections

There are two main ways to create and use Named Selections: Through the
Named Selection Window, and through the use of shortcut keys.

To create a Named Selection with a shortcut key, hold Ctrl-Shift and
press one of the numbers from 1-9. To recall a Named Selection with a
shortcut key, hold Ctrl and press the corresponding number from 1-9 that
was used when creating the Named Selection. The combination to recall a
Named Selection is shown next to the selection in the Named Selection
Window.

## Performing Unions (OR)

To perform a union (binary OR) operation, select two or more selections
from the Named Selections Window, and press the "Union" button. This
will result in all elements from each Named Selection (and the graph if
*\<Current Selection>* has been selected) being selected on the graph.

## Performing Intersections (AND)

To perform an intersection (binary AND) operation, select two or more
selections from the Named Selections Window, and press the
"Intersection" button. This will result in all common elements from each
Named Selection (and the graph if *\<Current Selection>* has been
selected) being selected on the graph, and all other elements being
unselected.

### Protecting Selections

To ensure a selection is not inadvertently deleted, it can be protected.
This can be achieved by right clicking the relevant Named Selection, and
selecting the "Protect Selection" menu item. A small padlock appears
next to protected Named Selections to indicate this mode.

### Cloning Selections

To create a duplicate of a Named Selection, right click it and select
"Clone Selection" from the menu. This will create a new named selection
that contains all of the elements that the original Named Selection
contained.

### Renaming Selections

Named Selections can be given meaningful names by highlighting the
selection in the Named Selection Window and pressing F2, or
right-clicking and selecting "Rename Selection". A prompt is shown where
a new name can be entered.

### Setting Selection Descriptions

Descriptions for Named Selections can be set by right-clicking a Named
Selection, and selecting "Set Selection Description" from the menu. A
prompt is shown where a description can be entered. If a Named Selection
has had a description appended, it will be placed in a tooltip if the
mouse is hovered over the Named Selection for a short period of time.
