# Animation

Graph animations in general are process intensive. They may require constant
updating of specific node/graph attributes. As such, it is best not to have any
views open before animating the graphs.

## Start animation
To start an animation, click on the graph to animate and select from the list
the desired animation
Eg. <b> Experimental -> Animations -> Direction Indicators </b>.

When an animation is selected, it should start immediately. A tick will be
displayed next to the animations that are currently running on the graph.
Multiple animations may be run on the same graph. Multiple graphs may run
animations simultaneously.

## Pause/Resume animating
To pause all animations on a graph, select the graph and click on
<b> Experimental -> Animations -> Pause Animating</b>.

This will pause all animations on the graph. Existing selected animations
will remain selected but animations are suspended.
To continue with the existing selected animations, select the graph and click
<b> Experimental -> Animations -> Resume Animating</b>.

## Stop animating
To stop all animations on a graph, select the graph and click on
<b> Experimental -> Animations -> Stop Animating</b>.
This will cancel all selected animations.
