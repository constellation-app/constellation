/**
 * Base class for animations.
 *
 * The flow of an animation is as follows: 
 * <ol><li> Animations initialize themselves by ensuring that the graph is in a state that the animation can modify.
 * Animations may check for specific attributes or node and transaction quantities. </li>
 * <li> Animations run in frames. With each frame obtaining a graph lock modifying the graph and releasing 
 * its lock to then wait a predefined amount of time before the next frame. </li>
 * <li> When an animation finishes, It may reset the graph to a particular state or trigger another animation. 
 * </li></ol>
 * All animations run on their own thread, enabling concurrent animations.
 * Animations may be disabled by an application option. In these cases animations with a finite number of 
 * steps can simply skip and perform the required graph modification in a single frame.
