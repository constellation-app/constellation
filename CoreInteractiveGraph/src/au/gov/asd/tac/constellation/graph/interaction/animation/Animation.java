/**
 * Base class for animations as well as static utilities for running animations.
 * <p>
 * The life-cycle of an animation is follows (this is a simplified version of
 * the logic that actually runs in an animation's thread):
 * <pre>
 * wg = graph.getWritableGraph()
 * animation.initialise(wg)
 * while (true) {
 *     animation.animate(wg)
 *     // wait for this long
 *     animation.getIntervalInMillis()
 * }
 * animation.reset(wg)
 * wg.commit()
 * </pre>
 * </p>
 * All animations run on their own thread, but at the moment only one animation
 * can be run at a time (this may be changed in the future if there is a
 * requirement).
