/**
 * Methods that translate from gestures in window coordinates, to values/actions
 * that make sense for the graph. The implementation details will be particular
 * to each VisualManager/VisualProcessor pair. For example, selecting nodes in a
 * box is an operation that theoretically makes sense for any visualisation of a
 * graph that allows interaction via swing events in window coordinates. However
 * the actual vertices that get selected given a specific box will depend
 * entirely on the visualisation's given method of projecting the 3D locations
 * of vertices from the graph into window coordinates. A visualisation is also
 * technically free to do whatever it likes, e.g. always show all vertices in a
 * grid (regardless of x,y,z on the graph) and hence box selection would work
 * very differently in this case
 *
 * Note that a key feature of the methods of this class is that they take inputs
 * in window coordinates, and produce outcomes or return results based on either
 * camera or graph coordinates. It is precisely the projection between window
 * coordinates and these other two coordinate systems that is specific to a give
 * VisualInteraction implementation. The projection between camera coordinates
 * and graph coordinates, however, is considered fixed throughout the
 * application (as the Camera is a part of the graph). Methods that work between
 * these two coordinate systems only (and do not involve window coordinates)
 * belong in static utility classes, CameraUtilities being the most prominent
 * example.
