### Why Should This Be In Core?

<!--

Explain why this functionality should be in Constellation Core as opposed to a
different module suite. Note that this question is more applicable when adding
new functionality. If this change is a minor update to an exising file then it
is understood that this change has to be to this module suite and a response
and therefore a response to this question is not required.
