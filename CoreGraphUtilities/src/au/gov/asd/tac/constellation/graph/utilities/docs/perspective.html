        <h1>Perspective view</h1>
        <p>
            The Perspective view allows you to bookmark a viewing position so you can return to it later.
            It lets you keep different perspectives on your graph.
        </p>
        <p>
            To add a perspective bookmark, move to the position you want to save, open the Perspective Bookmarks view,
            and select "Add a graph-relative perspective". A new bookmark with a default name will be added.
        </p>
        <p>
            Perspective bookmarks can be renamed and deleted. They will be saved with your graph so you can continue to use them.
