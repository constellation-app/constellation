        <h1>Getting Started</h1>
        
        <h2>Quick Start Guide</h2>
        <p>
            If you're looking to have a quick play around with Constellation to see what it can do, follow these steps to get a
            randomly generated graph that you can immediately start playing with:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Select File -&gt; New Graph.
                This will open a new window containing an empty graph.
            </li>
            <li>
                Select Experimental -&gt; Build Graph -&gt; Sphere Graph Builder to build a random spherical graph in the window.
            </li>
            <li>
                Select OK in the dialog box to accept the default values for a small graph. The graph will be built in the active 
                window.
            </li>
            <li>
                Select Views -&gt; Attribute Editor. This displays the attribute values of the current selection on the graph.
            </li>
            <li>
                Go <a href="/au/gov/asd/tac/constellation/functionality/docs/the-graph-window.html">here</a>
                to find out how navigate around the graph.
            </li>
            <li>
                Go <a href="/au/gov/asd/tac/constellation/graph/docs/graph-model.html">here</a> 
                to learn about the graph structure.
            </li>
        </ol>
