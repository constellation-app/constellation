Constellation is a graph-focused data visualisation and analysis application 
enabling data access, federation and manipulation capabilities across large and 
complex data sets.
<br>
<br>
Constellation was originally developed at the Australian Signals Directorate in 
2012 and transitioned to CSIRO's Data61 in May 2019 as open source software 
under the Apache 2 copyright license model for a 2 year period. In 2020 ASD 
once again took over the primary responsibility to maintain Constellation taking 
into account the contributions from the growing open source community.
