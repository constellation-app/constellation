        <h1>The Graph Window</h1>
        <p>
            The graph window provides a 3D visual display of a graph.
        </p>
        
        <div style="text-align: center">
            <img src="resources/GraphView.png" alt="The Graph Window" width="573" height="378">
        </div>

        <h2>Navigating The Graph</h2>
        <p>
            You can navigate the graph using the mouse and keyboard keys (refer 
            <a href="/au/gov/asd/tac/constellation/graph/interaction/docs/add-and-selection-modes.html">here</a> for the mouse 
            controls). Menus can be used to manipulate the graph. Some menus have keys assigned to them by default, but you can 
            change the key assignments using Tools -&gt; Options -&gt; Keymap.
        </p>

        <h2>Graph Sidebar</h2>
        <p>
            Each graph display has a sidebar containing some commonly used actions:
        </p>

        <table border="1">
            <caption>Actions that can be found on sidebar</caption>

                    Visualising a large graph will have an impact on performance so this helps reduce the load on the graphics card. 
                    You can still use the histogram and table view to clean up your data before you enable graph visualisation.

        <p>
            When links and edges are drawn and the underlying transactions have different colors, grey is used. When transactions 
            are drawn (each transaction is drawn with its own line), transactions are drawn individually up to a limit (default limit 
            is eight). If there are more than eight transactions between two nodes, they will be drawn as the corresponding edge. 
        </p>
        <p>
           Text can be drawn above and below nodes: use the graph-level attributes "node_labels_bottom" and "node_labels_top" to 
           determine what text is drawn. Similarly for transactions using the attribute "transaction_labels".
