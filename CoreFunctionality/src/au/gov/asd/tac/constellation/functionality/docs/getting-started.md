# Getting Started

## Quick Start Guide

If you're looking to have a quick play around with Constellation to see
what it can do, follow these steps to get a randomly generated graph
that you can immediately start playing with:

1.  Select File -> New Graph. This will open a new window containing an
    empty graph.
2.  Select Experimental -> Build Graph -> Sphere Graph Builder to build
    a random spherical graph in the window.
3.  Select OK in the dialog box to accept the default values for a small
    graph. The graph will be built in the active window.
4.  Select Views -> Attribute Editor. This displays the attribute values
    of the current selection on the graph.
5.  Go
    [here](../constellation/CoreFunctionality/src/au/gov/asd/tac/constellation/functionality/docs/the-graph-window.md)
    to find out how navigate around the graph.
6.  Go
    [here](../constellation/CoreGraphFramework/src/au/gov/asd/tac/constellation/graph/docs/graph-model.md)
    to learn about the graph structure.

## Importing Your Own Data

After following the above, you might want to look importing your own
data to analyse. Refer to the help pages in the Import/Export section
