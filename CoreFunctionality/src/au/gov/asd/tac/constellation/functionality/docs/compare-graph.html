        <h2>Compare Graph</h2>
        <p>
            Compare 2 graphs and show the differences in a new graph. The possible detected changes are additions, deletion and attribute changes.
        </p>

        <h2>Addition</h2>
        <p>If a node or transaction was added in the comparison graph, a new attribute called Compare will be set with the value set to <strong>Added</strong> and the colour will be changed to dark green by default.</p>


        <h2>Deletion</h2>
        <p>If a node or transaction was removed in the comparison graph, a new attribute called Compare will be set with the value set to <strong>Removed</strong> and the colour will be changed to red by default.</p>

        <h2>Modification</h2>
        <p>If an attribute on a node or transaction changed in the comparison graph, a new attribute called Compare will be set with the value set to <strong>Changed</strong> and the colour will be changed to yellow by default.</p>

        <h2>Options</h2>
        <p>
            When the comparison runs, a console will appear displaying the changes detected as descriptions.
        </p>

        <p>
            It is possible to ignore attributes like the x,y,z coordinates and change the colour scheme used.
