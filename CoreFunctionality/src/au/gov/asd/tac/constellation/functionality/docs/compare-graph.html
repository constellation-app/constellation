        <h1>Compare Graph</h1>
        <h2>Compare two graphs and show the differences in a new graph</h2>
        
        <p>
            Compare Graph can be accessed via Tools -&gt; Compare Graph
        </p>
        <p>
            Compare Graph does a comparison of two open graphs and shows the differences in a new graph. An output window will also 
            displayed with descriptions of the differences. Possible detected differences are additions, deletions, and 
            attribute value changes. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In the new graph, each node and transaction will be coloured according to the change detected. An attribute will also be 
            added called Compare with value set to whatever change was detected (Added, Removed, Modified, or Unchanged).
        </p>
