Import Graph File extracts the network structure from a local graph file and
displays the data in Constellation. Some of the file types it can extract 
from include GML, GraphML, and Pajek.

Note that at this stage it does not import graphs nested in nodes.

## Parameters

-   *File Type* - The type of the file to import. GML, GraphML, or Pajek can be selected from the dropdown.
-   *File* - Open the File to extract the graph from.
-   *Retrieve Transactions* - Enable this if you want to retrieve transactions as well as nodes
