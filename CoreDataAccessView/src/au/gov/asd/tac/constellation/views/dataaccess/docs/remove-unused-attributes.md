# Remove Unused Attributes

## Remove unused (non-key) attributes from your graph

This plugin removes any node and transaction attributes on the graph
that are not being used (i.e. contain no values).

NOTE: This is only applied to non-key attributes. Any key attributes
with no values will be retained.
