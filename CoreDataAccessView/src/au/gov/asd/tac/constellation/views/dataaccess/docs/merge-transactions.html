        <h1>Merge transactions</h1>
        <h2>Merge transactions in your graph together</h2>

        <p>
            This plugin is used to merge groups of transactions between the same two nodes which all occur within a specified time
            of each other. Transactions must have the same type (and, if it exists, activity) in order to be merged.
        </p>
        <p>
            Note that the DateTime, Activity and Type attributes must be defined for transactions for this work. 
        </p>
