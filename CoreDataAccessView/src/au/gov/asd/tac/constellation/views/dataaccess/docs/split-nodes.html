        <h1>Split Nodes Based on Identifier</h1>
        <h2>Split nodes based on supplied character(s) in the identifier</h2>
        
        <p>
            This plugin will split nodes based on whether a node Identifier contains a supplied character(s). 
        </p>
        <p>
            If a selected node contains the character(s) and Split on All Occurrences is not ticked, two new nodes will be created based on the first occurrence of the split
        </p>
        <p>
            If a selected node contains the character(s) and Split on All Occurrences is ticked, an additional node will be created for each additional split made(e.g. splitting an identifier in two places will create 3 nodes (being the original and 2 extracted))
        </p>

        <h2>Parameters</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><em>Split Character(s)</em> - Character(s) that are used to split the identifier. The character(s) itself is not included in any of the resulting nodes.</li>
            <li><em>Duplicate Transactions</em> - Make copies of transactions attached to the original node for each of the extracted nodes (exploding the node). Selecting this will result in no transaction being created between the original and extracted nodes</li>
            <li><em>Transaction Type</em> - Specify a transaction type that will represent the relationship between the original and extracted nodes (not applicable if Duplicate Transactions is ticked)</li>
            <li><em>Split on All Occurrences</em> - Split on all occurrences of the split character(s) in the identifier (rather than just the first occurrence)</li>
            <li><em>Complete with Schema</em> - Run Complete with Schema following the completion of the plugin</li>
        </ul>
