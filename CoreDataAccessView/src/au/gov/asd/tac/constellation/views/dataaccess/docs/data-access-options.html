        <h1>Saving and loading data access queries</h1>
        <p>
            Data access queries can be saved and loaded using "Save..." and "Load..." items in the "Options" menu in the top left corner of the Data Access View.
        </p>
        <p>
            When a query is saved, the first non-blank query name is used to name the saved query. If a query of that name has already
            been saved, you will be asked if you want to overwrite it. Queries are saved by default in the
            directory HOME_DIRECTORY/.CONSTELLATION/DataAccessView. (The name of the file in which the query is saved is
            encoded so it doesn't clash with file system limitations.) Files in this directory can be copied and deleted using
            your favourite file management utility.
        </p>
        <p>
            When you select "Load...", you will be presented with a list of saved queries. Select one from the list and select Ok.
            The query will be loaded and will appear exactly as it was when it was saved.
        </p>

        <h1>Saving data access results</h1>
        <p>
            The raw results of data access queries can be saved to files by toggling the "Save results" item in the "Options" menu
            in the top left corner of the Data Access View .
        </p>
        <p>
            When you first check the "Save results" item, a directory chooser dialog will appear so you can select the directory
            that the results will be saved to. The directory will be remembered and results will be saved until you uncheck
            the item, even if you exit CONSTELLATION and start again.
        </p>
        <p>
            To stop saving results, uncheck the "Save results" item. The next time you check it, CONSTELLATION will remember
            the folder that you were previously saving to, and use it as the initial directory for the directory chooser.
            (This is an easy way to find out where your save directory is.)
        </p>
        <p>
            Whenever you run a data access query with "Save results" checked, a status message will remind you where your results
            are being saved. If the directory has been removed, you will get an error notification and no results will be saved.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each plugin that saves results will create one or more files in your save directory. It is up to each plugin how
            it names the files it creates.
        </p>
