        <h1>Data Access View Options</h1>
        
        <p>
            All the options can be accessed via the <img src="resources/DataAccessOptions.png" alt="Options Button"> menu in the top left corner of the Data Access View.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Saving and loading data access preferences</h2>
        <p>
            Data access preferences can be saved and loaded using the "Save" and "Load..." options.
        </p>
        <p>
            When a preference is saved, you are prompted to name the preference. If a preference of that name has already
            been saved, you will be asked if you want to overwrite it.
            Preferences are saved by default in the directory HOME_DIRECTORY/.CONSTELLATION/DataAccessView.
            (The name of the file in which the preference is saved is encoded so it doesn't clash with file system limitations.)
            Files in this directory can be copied and deleted using your favourite file management utility.
        </p>
        <p>
            When you select "Load...", you will be presented with a list of saved preferences. Select one from the list and select Ok.
            The preference will be loaded and will appear exactly as it was when it was saved.
            You can also remove a saved preference from here by selecting one from the list and selecting Remove.
        </p>

        <h2>Saving data access results</h2>
        <p>
            The raw results of data access queries can be saved to files using the "Save Results" option.
        </p>
        <p>
            When you first check the "Save Results" item, a directory chooser dialog will appear so you can select the directory
            that the results will be saved to. The directory will be remembered and results will be saved until you uncheck
            the item, even if you exit Constellation and start again.
        </p>
        <p>
            To stop saving results, uncheck "Save Results". The next time you check it, Constellation will remember
            the folder that you were previously saving to, and use it as the initial directory for the directory chooser.
            (This is an easy way to find out where your save directory is.)
        </p>
        <p>
            Whenever you run a data access query with "Save Results" checked, a status message will remind you where your results
            are being saved. If the directory has been removed, you will get an error notification and no results will be saved.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each plugin that saves results will create one or more files in your save directory. It is up to each plugin how
            it names the files it creates.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Deselecting plugins on Go</h2>
        <p>
            Data Access plugins can be deselected after pressing the Go button via the "Deselect Plugins on Go" option.
        </p>
        <p>
            When you check the "Deselect Plugins on Go" item, data access plugins that are ticked will be deselected after pressing "Go".
            This will persist until the item is unchecked.
        </p>
        <p>
            When "Deselect Plugins on Go" is unchecked, data access plugins will remain ticked even after "Go" is pressed and will need to
            be unticked manually.
        </p>
