        <h2>Extract Words from a specified transaction attribute</h2>
        
        <p>
            This plugin will extract words from content (that is, words found in the specified content attribute of all transactions) and represent them as nodes on the graph. 
            The source node will be linked to the word by a transaction of type Referenced.
        </p>
