        <h1>Merge Nodes</h1>
        <h2>Merge nodes in your graph together</h2>

        <p>Merge nodes in your graph together based on the defined criteria.</p>

        <h2>Parameters</h2>
        <p>An explanation of the options are:</p>
        <p>
            <strong>Merge By</strong>: Nodes will be merged based on the following option:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Identifier Prefix Length - Will merge nodes matching the start of the Identifier attribute. The length to compare is defined by the threshold below</li>
            <li>Identifier Suffix Length - Will merge nodes matching the end of the Identifier attribute. The length to compare is defined by the threshold below</li>
            <li>Supported Type - Will merge nodes based on the type by merging supported types overriding those not supported.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <strong>Threshold</strong>: Threshold (length)
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Merging Rule</strong>: The rule deciding how attributes are merged is based on the following option:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Retain lead node attributes if present</li>
            <li>Retain lead node attributes always</li>
            <li>Copy merged node attributes if present</li>
            <li>Copy merged node attributes always</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <strong>Lead Node</strong>: The rule deciding how to choose the lead node based on the following option:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Longest Value - Based on the node's Identifier value length, use the node with the longer value</li>
            <li>Shortest Value - Based on the node's Identifier value length, use the node with the shorter value</li>
            <li>Ask Me - A dialog is displayed asking you to select the lead node by selecting its Identifier</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <strong>Selected Only</strong>: Merge Only Selected Nodes
        </p>
