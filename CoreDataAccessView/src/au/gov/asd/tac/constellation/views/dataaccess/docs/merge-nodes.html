        <h1>Merge Nodes</h1>
        <h2>Merge nodes in your graph together</h2>

        <p>Merge nodes in your graph together based on the defined criteria.</p>

        <h2>Parameters</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><em>Merge By</em> - The rule to determine when nodes should be merged together. Options include:
                <ul>
                    <li>Geospatial Distance - Will merge nodes within a particular geospatial distance of each other. The distance to compare is defined by the threshold</li>
                    <li>Identifier Prefix Length - Will merge nodes matching the start of the Identifier attribute. The length to compare is defined by the threshold</li>
                    <li>Identifier Suffix Length - Will merge nodes matching the end of the Identifier attribute. The length to compare is defined by the threshold</li>
                    <li>Supported Type - Will merge nodes based on the type by merging supported types overriding those not supported.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><em>Threshold</em> - The limit to apply to the selected rule (not applicable for Supported Type rule)</li>
            <li><em>Merging Rule</em> - The rule deciding how attributes are merged</li>
            <li><em>Lead Node</em> - The rule deciding how to choose the lead node (not applicable for Geospatial Distance or Supported Type rules). Options include:
                <ul>
                    <li>Longest Value - Use the node with the longer Identifier value length</li>
                    <li>Shortest Value - Use the node with the shorter Identifier value length</li>
                    <li>Ask Me - A dialog is displayed asking you to select the lead node by selecting its Identifier</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><em>Selected Only</em> - Only apply to selected nodes</li>
        </ul>
