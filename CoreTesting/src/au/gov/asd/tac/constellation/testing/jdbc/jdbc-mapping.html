        <h1>Import/Export JDBC - Mapping</h1>
        <p>
            The mapping panel defines the mappings between table columns and graph attributes.
        </p>
        <p>
            The "Default mappings" button will automatically map columns and attributes based on names.
            If two names are similar (after non-alphanumeric characters are removed, and the names converted to lower case,
            the names are equal), they will mapped by default. This does not guarantee that mappings are unique; you must
            still check the mappings for correctness.
        </p>
        <p>
            Graph attributes that are not mapped to table columns will not be exported. Likewise, table columns that are
            not mapped to graph attributes will not be imported. On export, all table columns must exist. On import,
            all graph attributes must exist.
        </p>
        <p>
            When either exporting or importing, the graph node id must have a mapping to a table column, and the graph
            transaction id, transaction source, and transaction destination must have a mapping to a table column.
            (The transaction directed attribute to indicate whether a transaction is directed or not is optional. If the
            directed attribute is not mapped on import, transactions are assumed to be directed.)
        </p>
        <p>
            It is assumed that mapped table columns have the correct data type for the mapped graph attribute. JDBC operations
            are done based on the attribute type, not the column type.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Save button can be used to save this export/import session. The data in each of the panels will be saved,
            so you don't have to reenter most information the next time you do an export/import. It is recommended that you save
            your session in case of errors.
        </p>
        <p>
            JDBC import/export sessions are saved in
            <span class="mono"><i>HOME_DIRECTORY</i>/.CONSTELLATION/ImportExportJDBC</span>. Each file is saved JDBC session.
        </p>
        <p>
            Selecting Finish will cause the export/import to be done.
        </p>
        <p>
            When exporting, all graph elements will be exported, whether they are selected or not.
        </p>
        <p>
            When importing, the node ids in the table column will not be used to create nodes in the graph. Instead,
            nodes will be added with the next available node id. This avoids clashes with existing nodes. Transactions
            will be added to the correct nodes. When the import is complete, the current graph's schema will be applied.
            This may result in nodes being merged.
        </p>
