        <h2>Open Graph</h2>
        <p>
            Used to open a Constellation graph file. The standard menu for opening
            Constellation files is: <em>File &rarr; Open</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            This command presents a dialog for selecting a file. Once the dialog is dismissed,
            the file is read and the contents displayed in a new graph window.
        </p>
        <p>
            Constellation graph files are identified by the file suffix <strong>.star</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Constellation will not allow the user to open a graph file that is already open.
        </p>
        <p>
            Note: The user may also open a Constellation file by dragging the file over the Constellation interface.
