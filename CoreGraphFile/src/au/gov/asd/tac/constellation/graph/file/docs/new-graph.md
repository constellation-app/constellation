# New Graph

There are a few different ways to open a new empty graph:

## File Menu

Navigate to File -> New Graph to choose which sort of graph you want to
create. The options available correspond to the available schemas (e.g.
Analytic, Visual). Alternatively, the top option in the File menu
drop-down will allow you create a new empty graph with the default
schema.

## Top Toolbar

Clicking on the icon on the far left of the top toolbar will open up a
new empty graph with the default schema.

## Welcome Page

The Welcome Page may also provide one or more ways to open a new empty
graph. There will typically be an option to open one with the default
schema.
