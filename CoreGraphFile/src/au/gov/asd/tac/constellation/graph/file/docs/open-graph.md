# Open Graph

There are a few different ways to open an existing graph:

## File Menu

Navigate to File -> Open Graph to open the File Explorer from which you
can choose the graph to open. Graph Files are identified by the file
suffix ".star". Alternatively, navigate to File -> Open Recent to open a
recent graph without having to go through the File Explorer.

## Welcome Page

The Welcome Page also provides ways to open a graph. One option is
clicking on the Open button which will open up the File Explorer. Each
recent graph also has its own button (up to 10 recent graphs) which when
clicked will open up the corresponding graph.

## Drag and Drop

You can also drag and drop a graph into Constellation. Choose the graph
file you want to open and drag it into the tab area at the top of the
graph window (you will see a "+Copy" when you can drop it).
