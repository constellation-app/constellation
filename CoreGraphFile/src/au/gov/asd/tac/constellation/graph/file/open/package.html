            The source files in this package have been copied/forked from org.netbeans.modules.openfile.
            There are four reasons for this. (1) This package is in the "User Utilities" module, which does not expose an API,
            so we would need a dependency on the implementation. Bad. (2) There are other things in the "User Utilities" module
            that we don't want. (3) We need to change the source of FileChooser to make our filter have precedence over the
            default filter. (4) We want to change the way that the recent files list works. The default is to add files to the
            list when a TC closes, and remove them when a TC opens. However, when the application closes, the PROP_TC_CLOSED
            doesn't get fired, and the list isn't updated. Instead, our change is to add the file to the list when it is opened.
