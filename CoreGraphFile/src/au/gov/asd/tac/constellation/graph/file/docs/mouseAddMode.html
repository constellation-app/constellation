        <h2>Mouse Actions: Add Mode</h2>
        <p>
            Enter new nodes and transactions by clicking the left mouse button when in 'Add' mode.
        </p>

        <h3>Create a node</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Position the cursor over an unused area (or above a transaction) and click the left mouse button</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Create a single transaction</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>To start the transaction, position the cursor over a node and click the left mouse button</li>
            <li>To end the transaction, position the cursor over another node (optionally the same one) and click the left mouse button</li>
            <li>Clicking in an empty space or pressing the ESC (escape) key will abort the current transaction.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Create a sequence of transactions</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>To enter a new transaction, position the cursor over a node and click the left mouse button</li>
            <li>
                Complete the first transaction by positioning the cursor over another node (optionally the same one) and clicking the left mouse button along
                with the control-key. A second transaction will automatically be created starting from the end position of the previous transaction.
            </li>
            <li>Continue clicking with the left mouse button with the control-key to complete the current transaction and to start another one.</li>
            <li>For the last transaction, simply click with the left mouse button without the control-key to complete the current transaction and to end the sequence.</li>
            <li>Clicking in an empty space or pressing the ESC (escape) key will also abort the current transaction.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Create a series of transactions starting from the same node</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>To enter a new transaction, position the cursor over a node and click the left mouse button</li>
            <li>
                Complete the first transaction by positioning the cursor over another node (optionally the same one) and clicking the left mouse button along with
                the shift-key. A second transaction will automatically be created from the start of the first transaction.
            </li>
            <li>Continue clicking with the left mouse button with the shift-key to complete the current transaction and to start another one.
            <li>For the last transaction, simply click with the left mouse button without holding the shift-key to complete the current transaction and end the sequence.
            <li>Clicking in an empty space or pressing the ESC (escape) key will abort the current transaction.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Note:</strong> When creating nodes and transactions in add mode, the application automatically populates the attribute <strong>Source</strong> with the value "Manually Created".
