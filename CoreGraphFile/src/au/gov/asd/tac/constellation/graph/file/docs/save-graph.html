        <h1>Save Graph</h1>
               
        <p>
            Constellation saves the graph to a custom format (check it out 
            <a href="/au/gov/asd/tac/constellation/graph/docs/constellation-file-format.html">here</a>) 
            with file suffix ".star". A saved Constellation file retains almost everything about the 
            graph's current state including layout, selections, attribute definitions and values.
        </p>
        <p>
            When a file has changes pending, its name (in the upper tab) appear bolded in blue, 
            otherwise it is shown in simple black text.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are a few different ways to save a graph:
        </p>
        
        <h2>Save</h2>
        <p>
            File -&gt; Save will prompt you for a file name the first time the file is being saved. 
            Otherwise, it will use the current name.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Save As</h2>
        <p>
            File -&gt; Save As can be used with new or existing graphs to explicitly save the information 
            to a specific file. Constellation won't allow you to specify an existing filename for another 
            currently open graph.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Save All</h2>
        <p>
            File -&gt; Save All can be used to save all currently open graphs. If any of them are being 
            saved for the first time, you will be prompted for a file name for each one that requires it.
        </p>
