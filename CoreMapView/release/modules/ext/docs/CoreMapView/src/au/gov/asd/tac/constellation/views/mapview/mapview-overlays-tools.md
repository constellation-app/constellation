## Measure

The measure tool allows you to measure a distance on the map. This
measurement will be an approximation calculated using the Haversine
distance metric. To enable the measure tool, simply click anywhere
inside the measure box (a red border will indicate that it is active).
Then to use the tool, simply click on the map at the start position,
then click again at the end position and the measure box will be updated
with the straight line distance. Alternatively, you can hold shift while
you click to draw a circle radius, or hold control to draw a complex
path.

## Draw

The draw tool allows you to draw custom markers on the map. To enable
the draw tool, simply click anywhere inside the draw box (a red border
will indicate that it is active). Then to use the tool, simply click
anywhere on the map to draw a point marker. Alternatively, you can hold
shift while you click to draw a circle marker, or hold control to draw a
complex polygon.
