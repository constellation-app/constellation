        <h1>Paths Layers</h1>
        <p>
            The paths layers in the Map View will connect markers together to indicate paths. Paths
            are rendered using colored lines, with a lighter color indicating the beginning of the
            path and a darker color representing the end. Lines are offset slightly so that lines in
            opposite directions are not drawn on top of each other. The thickness of a line can be
            used to represent a weight.
        </p>
        <h2>Entity Paths</h2>
        <p>
            Entity paths represent how nodes on the graph travel between locations. These transactions
            can be of any type (not just Location). Paths are weighted by the number of times the node
            travels between the two endpoint locations.
        </p>
        <h2>Location Paths</h2>
        <p>
            Location paths represent paths between location nodes that are directly connected. These
            transactions can be of any type (not just Location) but must be directed. Paths are weighted
            by the number of transactions between the two endpoint locations. If the maximum number of
            transactions in a single direction between locations is greater than the maximum line width,
            the widths will be scaled to the maximum line width.
