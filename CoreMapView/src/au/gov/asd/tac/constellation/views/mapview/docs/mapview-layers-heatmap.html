        <h1>Heatmap Layers</h1>
        <p>
            The heatmap layers in the Map View will generate a Gaussian Blur around all markers
            to indicate density. This density can be weighted in various ways.
            could represent the number of markers (standard),
            the number of nodes connected to markers (popularity), or the number of transactions
            connected to markers (activity).
        </p>
        <h2>Standard Heatmap</h2>
        <p>
            The standard heatmap represents the density of nodes at a location. This means
            that a marker representing two nodes on the graph will appear hotter than a marker
            representing only one node.
        </p>
        <h2>Popularity Heatmap</h2>
        <p>
            The popularity heatmap represents the density of nodes connected to a location.
            This means that a marker representing a node with two neighbours on the graph will
            appear hotter than a marker representing a node with only one neighbour.
        </p>
        <h2>Activity Heatmap</h2>
        <p>
            The activity heatmap represents the density of transactions connected to a location.
            This means that a marker representing a node with two adjacent transactions on the graph
            will appear hotter than a marker representing a node with only one adjacent transaction.
