# Heatmap Layers

The heatmap layers in the Map View will generate a Gaussian Blur around
all markers to indicate density. This density can be weighted in various
ways. It could represent the number of markers (standard), the number of
nodes connected to markers (popularity), or the number of transactions
connected to markers (activity).

## Heatmap (Standard)

The standard heatmap represents the density of nodes at a location. This
means that a marker representing two nodes on the graph will appear
hotter than a marker representing only one node.

## Heatmap (Popularity)

The popularity heatmap represents the density of nodes connected to a
location. This means that a marker representing a node with two
neighbours on the graph will appear hotter than a marker representing a
node with only one neighbour.

## Heatmap (Heatmap)

The activity heatmap represents the density of transactions connected to
a location. This means that a marker representing a node with two
adjacent transactions on the graph will appear hotter than a marker
representing a node with only one adjacent transaction.
