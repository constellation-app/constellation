            Scripting View
        </h1>
        <p>
            Welcome to the Constellation Scripting View! This document will walk
            you through the API, describing the available graph and plugin
            operations as well as any other functions available to you.
        </p>
        <h2>
            The Basics
        </h2>
        <p>
            The Scripting View provides access any open graph in Constellation
            programmatically via a range of scripting languages (with Python
            being the preferred language). It is able to access any part of
            Constellation's internal public API, ie. anything a Constellation
            developer can access) as well as easy-to-use scripting specific
            data-structures.
        </p>
        <p>
            When you open the Scripting View, it will initialise several custom
            objects for you to make use of in your scripts.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>graph</strong>: this object represents the current
                active graph, and allows you to take a copy for reading from
                using <em>readableGraph()</em>, or a copy for writing to using
                <em>writableGraph(editName)</em>. For information on how to use
                this object, refer to the
                <a href="javadoc/au-gov-asd-tac-constellation-scripting/au/gov/asd/tac/constellation/scripting/graph/SGraph.html">javadoc</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>utilities</strong>: this object provides various
                convenience functions provided by the core developers,
                for example, <em>openFile(dirKey)</em> to activate a
                Netbeans file open dialog and return the selected file path
                as a string. If your chosen scripting language is Python, you
                can use its <em>dir</em> function to see what else is
                available, otherwise refer to the
                <a href="javadoc/au-gov-asd-tac-constellation-scripting/au/gov/asd/tac/constellation/scripting/utilities/ScriptingUtilities.html">javadoc</a>
                for more information on how to use this object.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            You can add your own custom objects by extending the ScriptingModule
            class in the Scripting Module. Speak to your developers for more
            information on what they have added, or to include your own custom
            scripting objects.
        </p>
        <h2>
            The Graph
        </h2>
        <p>
            The current active graph is always readily accessible using the
            provided <strong>graph</strong> object, which provides a number of
            convenient methods for reading from and writing to the graph. Under
            the hood, the graph object is an <em>SGraph</em>, which provides
            access for interrogation and editing of the underlying Constellation
            graph. The SGraph object, as well as all the objects obtainable from an
            SGraph are documented in the
            <a href="javadoc/au-gov-asd-tac-constellation-scripting/index.html">API javadoc</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can access all other open graphs using the
            <strong>utilities</strong> object as follows:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>getOpenGraphs()</strong> will return a map or
                dictionary of graph name to graph for every currently open
                graph.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            You can also make a copy of a graph using the
            <strong>utilities</strong> object as follows:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>copyGraph(graph)</strong> will return an in-memory
                copy of the provided graph.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>
            Plugins
        </h2>
        <p>
            Every user action in Constellation is designed to be a disposable
            operation (generally on the graph) called a plugin. The Scripting
            View provides the ability to run any plugin available to
            Constellation using the provided <strong>utilities</strong> object.
            The utilities object provides two ways to run a plugin:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>executePlugin(graph, pluginName)</strong> allows you
                to run a plugin by name with default parameter values.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>executePlugin(graph, pluginName, pluginParameters)</strong>
                allows you to run a plugin by name with custom parameter
                values. Parameter values should be provided as a map or
                dictionary of parameter names as strings to parameter values
                as strings.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Plugin names and parameters are documented in the <em>Plugins</em> tab
            of the Schema View within Constellation.
