        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            The Scripting View provides access to any open graph in Constellation programmatically via a range of scripting 
            languages (with Python being the preferred language). It is able to access any part of Constellation's internal public 
            API, ie. anything a Constellation developer can access) as well as easy-to-use scripting specific data-structures.
        </p>
        
        <div style="text-align: center">
            <img src="resources/ScriptingView.png" alt="Scripting View">
        </div>
        
        <p>
            When you open the Scripting View, it will initialise several custom
            objects for you to make use of in your scripts:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><em>graph</em> - 
                This object represents the current active graph, and allows you to take a copy for reading from using 
                "readableGraph()", or a copy for writing to using "writableGraph(editName)". For information on how to use this 
                object, refer to the
                <a href="javadoc/au-gov-asd-tac-constellation-scripting/au/gov/asd/tac/constellation/scripting/graph/SGraph.html">javadoc</a>.
            </li>
            <li><em>utilities</em> - 
                This object provides various convenience functions provided by the core developers (e.g. "openFile(dirKey)" to 
                activate a Netbeans file open dialog and return the selected file path as a string). If your chosen scripting 
                language is Python, you can use its "dir" function to see what else is available, otherwise refer to the
                <a href="javadoc/au-gov-asd-tac-constellation-scripting/au/gov/asd/tac/constellation/scripting/utilities/ScriptingUtilities.html">javadoc</a>
                for more information on how to use this object.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            You can add your own custom objects by extending the ScriptingModule class in the Scripting Module. Speak to your 
            developers for more information on what they have added, or to include your own custom scripting objects.
        </p>
        
        <h2>The Graph</h2>
        <p>
            The current active graph is always readily accessible using the provided graph object and provides a number of
            convenient methods for reading from and writing to the graph. Under the hood, the graph object is an "SGraph", which 
            provides access for interrogation and editing of the underlying Constellation graph. The SGraph object, as well as all 
            the objects obtainable from an SGraph are documented in the
            <a href="javadoc/au-gov-asd-tac-constellation-scripting/index.html">API javadoc</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Using the utilities object, you can access all other open graphs using "getOpenGraphs()". This function will return a 
            map or dictionary of graph name to graph for every currently open graph.
        </p>
        <p>
            The utilities object can also be used to make a copy of graph through "copyGraph(graph)" This will return an in-memory 
            copy of the provided graph.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Plugins</h2>
        <p>
            Every user action in Constellation is designed to be a disposable operation (generally on the graph) called a plugin. 
            The Scripting View provides the ability to run any plugin available to Constellation using the provided utilities object.
            The utilities object provides two ways to run a plugin:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><em>executePlugin(graph, pluginName)</em> - 
                Allows you to run a plugin by name with default parameter values.
            </li>
            <li><em>executePlugin(graph, pluginName, pluginParameters)</em> - 
                Allows you to run a plugin by name with custom parameter values. Parameter values should be provided as a map or 
                dictionary of parameter names as strings to parameter values as strings.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Plugin names and parameters are documented in the Plugins tab of the Schema View within Constellation.
