# How This API Document Is Organized

<div class="subTitle">

This API (Application Programming Interface) document has pages
corresponding to the items in the navigation bar, described as follows.

</div>

</div>

<div class="contentContainer">

-   ## Overview

    The [Overview](../constellation/CoreScriptingView/src/au/gov/asd/tac/constellation/scripting/docs/javadoc/overview-summary.md) page is the front page of this
    API document and provides a list of all packages with a summary for
    each. This page can also contain an overall description of the set
    of packages.

-   ## Package

    Each package has a page that contains a list of its classes and
    interfaces, with a summary for each. This page can contain six
    categories:

    -   Interfaces (italic)
    -   Classes
    -   Enums
    -   Exceptions
    -   Errors
    -   Annotation Types

-   ## Class/Interface

    Each class, interface, nested class and nested interface has its own
    separate page. Each of these pages has three sections consisting of
    a class/interface description, summary tables, and detailed member
    descriptions:

    -   Class inheritance diagram
    -   Direct Subclasses
    -   All Known Subinterfaces
    -   All Known Implementing Classes
    -   Class/interface declaration
    -   Class/interface description

    <!-- -->

    -   Nested Class Summary
    -   Field Summary
    -   Constructor Summary
    -   Method Summary

    <!-- -->

    -   Field Detail
    -   Constructor Detail
    -   Method Detail

    Each summary entry contains the first sentence from the detailed
    description for that item. The summary entries are alphabetical,
    while the detailed descriptions are in the order they appear in the
    source code. This preserves the logical groupings established by the
    programmer.

-   ## Annotation Type

    Each annotation type has its own separate page with the following
    sections:

    -   Annotation Type declaration
    -   Annotation Type description
    -   Required Element Summary
    -   Optional Element Summary
    -   Element Detail

-   ## Enum

    Each enum has its own separate page with the following sections:

    -   Enum declaration
    -   Enum description
    -   Enum Constant Summary
    -   Enum Constant Detail

-   ## Tree (Class Hierarchy)

    There is a [Class Hierarchy](../constellation/CoreScriptingView/src/au/gov/asd/tac/constellation/scripting/docs/javadoc/overview-tree.md) page for all
    packages, plus a hierarchy for each package. Each hierarchy page
    contains a list of classes and a list of interfaces. The classes are
    organized by inheritance structure starting with `java.lang.Object`.
    The interfaces do not inherit from `java.lang.Object`.

    -   When viewing the Overview page, clicking on "Tree" displays the
        hierarchy for all packages.
    -   When viewing a particular package, class or interface page,
        clicking "Tree" displays the hierarchy for only that package.

-   ## Deprecated API

    The [Deprecated API](../constellation/CoreScriptingView/src/au/gov/asd/tac/constellation/scripting/docs/javadoc/deprecated-list.md) page lists all of the API
    that have been deprecated. A deprecated API is not recommended for
    use, generally due to improvements, and a replacement API is usually
    given. Deprecated APIs may be removed in future implementations.

-   ## Index

    The [Index](../constellation/CoreScriptingView/src/au/gov/asd/tac/constellation/scripting/docs/javadoc/index-all.md) contains an alphabetic list of all
    classes, interfaces, constructors, methods, and fields.

-   ## Prev/Next

    These links take you to the next or previous class, interface,
    package, or related page.

-   ## Frames/No Frames

    These links show and hide the HTML frames. All pages are available
    with or without frames.

-   ## All Classes

    The [All Classes](../constellation/CoreScriptingView/src/au/gov/asd/tac/constellation/scripting/docs/javadoc/allclasses-noframe.md) link shows all classes
    and interfaces except non-static nested types.

-   ## Serialized Form

    Each serializable or externalizable class has a description of its
    serialization fields and methods. This information is of interest to
    re-implementors, not to developers using the API. While there is no
    link in the navigation bar, you can get to this information by going
    to any serialized class and clicking "Serialized Form" in the "See
    also" section of the class description.

-   ## Constant Field Values

    The [Constant Field Values](../constellation/CoreScriptingView/src/au/gov/asd/tac/constellation/scripting/docs/javadoc/constant-values.md) page lists the
    static final fields and their values.
