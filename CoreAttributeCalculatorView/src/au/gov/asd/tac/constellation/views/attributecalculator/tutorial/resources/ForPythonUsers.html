        Attribute Calculator uses the java scripting engine implementation of python 2, called jython.
        When you run an attribute calculator script on a number of graph elements (nodes or transactions),
        CONSTELLATION will use jython to evaluate that script once for each graph element and store the result in the
        destination attribute for that element.
    </p>

    <p class='text'>
        Prior to that evaluation, however, attribute calculator uses its own Domain Specific Language
        (DSL) translator to convert attribute names, graph properties and special functions into python
        objects with the desired behvaiour. The following list contains a number of notes briefly describing the
        important bits about the way this is done and how it might affect the writing of scripts.
    </p>

    <ul class='text'>
        <li>
            <strong> Context </strong> - the context is the current node or transaction that is being looked at.
            Obviously this changes each time a script is evaluated for a new graph element.
            However, the context might also change within the execution of a script, for example if a
            function which looks at neighbours is used.
        </li><li>
            <strong> Context Switches </strong> - The context is also aware of whether it is looking
            at a node or a transaction. Some functions like <strong>has_transaction</strong> will switch between
            the two types of contexts. Attributes, properties and functions may only work in node or transaction
            contexts (this is documented in attribute calculator's help column on the right-hand side).
        </li><li>
            <strong> Attributes and Properties </strong> - Attributes and properties are translated to calling a 'getCurrentValue' method on special objects which are aware of the
            aforementioned context.
        </li><li>
            <strong> Attributes Names </strong> - Attributes whose names contain python syntax characters are escaped
            prior to any further processing, so that they don't clash with python syntax. The caveat is that attribute
            names always take precedent over the python syntactical interpretation, so if one had an attribute named
            <strong>2</strong> in a graph, then it would be impossible to use the integer literal <strong>2</strong>.
            int('2') could, however, be used. This is mostly a theoretical problem, as the only python syntactical
            character that tends to appear in attribute names is the full stop.
        </li><li>
            <strong> Function Calls </strong> - Calls to inbuilt python functions work exactly as normal.
            However many of the special attribute calculator functions are translated prior to evaluation so that their
            arguments are wrapped in a lambda.
            Examples of these include the <strong>has_neighbour</strong> and <strong>count_neighbour</strong> functions.
            Wrapping these arguments in lambdas is necessary so that the expressions passed to these functions
            are evaluated with respect to the contexts of the neighbours, rather than the context of the root node.
        </li><li>
            <strong> Python Script vs Expression </strong> - All the previous examples (and inbuilt scripts) have
            been python expressions, the result of which is stored in the destination attribute. However, full pythons scripts
            can also be used. Attribute calculator uses python's abstract syntax tree module to detect whether the script
            is more than a python expression, and in this case, wraps the entire script in a zero-argument <strong>def</strong>
            which it subsequently calls for each graph element. Any python syntax is valid inside a def, so there is no limitation
            in this case, however you must explicitly return values from a script with the <strong>return</strong> statement since python
            has no concept of 'the last evaluated statement' such as languages like perl.
