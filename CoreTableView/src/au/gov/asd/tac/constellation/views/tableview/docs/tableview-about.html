        <h2>Table View</h2>
        <p>
            The table view presents the attributes for all the nodes and transactions in the graph.
            The highlighted rows in the table represent the selected elements in the graph. The check box 
            in the 'selected' column is also checked when an element is selected in the graph.
            Selection of the table rows (including the use of the shift and control buttons) will result in
            the selection of the table rows and the associated elements in the graph itself. Conversely, changes
            in the selection set of the graph are reflected in the table.
            <BR>
            The table displays the attributes for all selected and unselected nodes and transactions.

        <h3>Column Definition</h3>
        <P>
            The set of columns displayed in the table can be modified by selecting the button <img src="resources/editColumns.png" alt="" width="20" height="20">.<BR>
        </P>
        <h3>Row Ordering</h3>
        <P>
            The table rows can be sorting by selecting any of the column headers.
        </P>
        <h3>Copy Data</h3>
        <P>
            There are multiple ways to copy data from the Table. All copy operations will produce a comma separated output. The data is only copied to the clipboard.        
        </P>
        <h4>Copy all rows</h4>
        <p>This operation copies all column and all rows within the table. The order of the column values is the same as how it is listed on the table. This operation can be slow with a large graph.</p>
        <h4>Copy selected rows</h4>
        <p>This operation copies all column and selected rows within the table. The order of the column values is the same as how it is listed on the table.</p>
        <h4>Copy columns</h4>
        <p>This operation provides the user the option to select specific column(s) and specific rows. The order is alphabetical by default.</p>
        <img src="resources/copydialog.png" alt="" width="544" height="452">
        <p>Column names that are listed on the right will be copied. The column list on the right can be reordered to determine the order of the output. Use the up and down arrows on the right to reorder the colum names. 
            The "Copy selected row(s) only" check box allows user to choose whether they would like to copy all rows or just the rows that are currently selected.</p>
