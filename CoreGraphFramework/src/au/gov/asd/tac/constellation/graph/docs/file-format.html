        <h1>CONSTELLATION file format</h1>

        <p>This document describes version 1 of the CONSTELLATION file format.</p>

        <p>For examples of using Python to manipulate saved graphs, see ...</p>

        <p>
            CONSTELLATION saves graphs in a <span class="tt">.star</span> file. This is simply a container in <span class="tt">zip</span> format 
            that holds the graph file <span class="tt">graph.txt</span> and optionally other files, such as node icons.
        </p>

        <p>
            This file format is also used when a graph is exported to JSON. There are two differences between saving and exporting.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                A graph is saved in a zip file with the JSON representation in a zipfile entry called graph.txt. A graph is exported to a file 
                called <em>name</em>.json, with ancillary files named using UUIDs.
            </li>
            <li>
                A saved graph (in a .star file) does not contain entries for element values where the values are equal to the element's 
                default value. For instance, if the element <span class="tt">color</span> has a default of "red", then elements where the 
                color value is red will not have that value written to the file. This can result in significant space saving when writing,
                and when the file is read, can result in a significant time saving. An exported graph will contain all values of all elements.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Other than these two differences, the description below applies to both variations.
        </p>

        <h2>graph.txt</h2>

        <p>
            The <span class="tt">graph.txt</span> file contains data in UTF-8 encoded JSON format that represents a graph. To extract the data 
            manually, an unzip utility can be used. The simplest way of doing this in Windows is to append <span class="tt">.zip</span> to the 
            filename (so the file type is recognised) and double-click on the file in Windows Explorer.
        </p>

        <p>
            Because the storage format is JSON, any language with a JSON parser can read the graph. In particular, Python can be used to read 
            and write a JSON file in a zip container.
        </p>

        <p>
            The output shown below from a Python script demonstrates the top-level structure of a JSON document that describes a CONSTELLATION 
            graph. See ... for more Python examples.
        </p>

        <pre>
            [ { u'attribute_mod_count': 65,
                u'global_mod_count': 591,
                u'schema': u'au.gov.asd.tac.constellation.schema.InteractiveSchemaFactory',
                u'structure_mod_count': 65,
                u'version': 1},
              { u'graph': [{ u'attrs': [...]}, { u'data': [...]}]},
              { u'vertex': [{ u'attrs': [...]}, { u'data': [...]}]},
              { u'transaction': [{ u'attrs': [...]}, { u'data': [...]}]},
              { u'meta': [{ u'attrs': [...]}, { u'data': [...]}]}]
        </pre>

        <p>
            Furthermore, CONSTELLATION encodes the JSON document in "pretty-printed" style, so it is
            possible to use simple tools such as grep(1) to search for text.
        </p>

        <h2>graph.txt sections</h2>

        <p>
            The outermost structure of the graph is an ordered list containing five elements. Each element
            (apart from 'version') contains a dictionary with a single key defining the graph section contained
            in that element. The sections must appear in the
            following order.
        </p>

        <dl>
            <dt>version</dt>
            <dd>
                An integer version number that defines the remaining structure.
                Currently only version 1 is defined. This section may also contain other unspecified data.
            </dd>
            <dt>graph</dt>
            <dd>Contains data relevant to the graph, for instance, background colour.</dd>
            <dt>vertex</dt>
            <dd>Contains data relevant to the vertices, for instance, the name of the vertex.</dd>
            <dt>transaction</dt>
            <dd>Contains data relevant to the transactions, for instance, line style.</dd>
            <dt>meta</dt>
            <dd>
                Contains data about the graph environment, for instance, the attributes used for displaying
                labels.
            </dd>
        </dl>

        <p>
            Why do it like this? Why not just a use a top-level dictionary containing the
            section keys? Unlike XML, JSON objects contain unordered name/value pairs. This
            means that (for example) when a Python dictionary is serialised, the 'transaction' key might
            appear before the 'vertex' key in the resulting JSON. Since transactions can't be added to the
            graph before their corresponding vertices, this would require that the entire structure be
            loaded into memory to ensure that 'vertex' could be accessed first, which would not
            be a good idea for large graphs.
        <p>

        <p>
            By making the top-level structure a JSON array with a specified order, the data
            can be streamed from the file in the required order, making graph reading more efficient.
        </p>

        <p>
            Given that the order is defined, putting a JSON object with a single name in each
            element is superfluous. However, the name provides a built-in level of documentation,
            makes the file (slightly) more readable, and adds little overhead when reading and
            writing the file.
        </p>

        <p>
            Each graph section 'graph', 'vertex', 'transaction', 'meta' contains data with
            the same format: a list of two single-named objects.
        </p>

        <p>
            (The structure here is a list of single-named dictionaries, rather than a single
            dictionary with two names, for the same reason that the top-most structure is a list
            of single-named dictionaries: the attributes must be defined before they can be
            used.
        </p>

        <dl>
            <dt>attrs</dt>
            <dd>
                Defines the attributes used by this section of the graph. The value of this object is an
                array of objects, where each object is an attributes definition.
            </dd>
            <dt>data</dt>
            <dd>
                Defines the data in this section of the graph. The value of this object is an array of
                objects, where each object is a graph datum corresponding to the current section of
                the document.
            </dd>
        </dl>

        <p>
            If an object does not define a name, the value of that name is assumed to be null.
            For instance, if the 'vertex' 'attrs' section defines a 'Country' attribute, and
            an object in the 'vertex' 'data' section has no 'Country' name, then the resulting
            graph will have a 'Country' value of null.
        </p>

        <h3>Attributes</h3>

        <p>
            Attributes define the data values that are attached to elements of the graph. Each attribute
            has four components.
        </p>

        <dl>
            <dt>label</dt>
            <dd>The name of the attribute.</dd>
            <dt>type</dt>
            <dd>The type of attribute (see below).</dd>
            <dt>descr</dt>
            <dd>A description of the attribute. (Optional.)</dd>
            <dt>default</dt>
            <dd>The default value. (Optional.)</dd>
        </dl>

        <p>
            Attributes are defined separately in each graph section; an attribute defined in the 'vertex'
            section cannot be used in the 'transaction' section.
        </p>

        <h3>Data types</h3>

        <p>
            CONSTELLATION defines some built-in data types. These are listed below.
        </p>

        <p>
            All data type values have string representations so they can be round-tripped from their internal
            representation, to a JSON document when saved, and back to their internal representation when
            loaded (although some floating point numbers may not be retrieved exactly due to the inexactness
            inherent in the string representation). (Obviously this round-tripping would work for other string
            formats such as CSV.)
        </p>

        <dl>
            <dt>boolean</dt>
            <dd>A true/false value, represented by the strings 'true' and 'false'.</dd>
            <dt>blaze</dt>
            <dd>
                A node marker. The string representation has the format "angle;color;icon;isDisplayed".
                <ul>
                    <li>angle - degrees clockwise from 12 o'clock</li>
                    <li>color - see color type</li>
                    <li>icon - see icon type</li>
                    <li>isDisplayed - true or false indicating whether the blaze is displayed or not.
                </ul>
                For example: "45;LightBlue;Sphere_48;true".
            </dd>
            <dt>color</dt>
            <dd>
                An RGBA color. This value has two representations: a name ('red', 'green', 'blue', ...),
                or a comma-separated list of four floating-point numbers between 0 and 1 inclusive
                representing the red, green, blue, and alpha components of the color. The alpha component is
                optional; if it is not present, it defaults to 1. For instance 'red', '1,0,0' and
                and '1,0,0,1' are equivalent, as are 'DarkGreen' and '0,0.5,0'. Note that the alpha
                component is often ignored by CONSTELLATION; for instance, an alpha component of 0.5 in a node
                color will not result in a semi-transparent background icon.
            </dd>
            <dt>date</dt>
            <dd>
                A date. The representation is ISO 8601 format: "YYYY-MMM-DD".
            </dd>
            <dt>datetime</dt>
            <dd>
                A datetime. The representation is ISO 8601 format with 'T' replaced by ' ':
                "YYYY-MMM-DD hh:mm:ss". Datetime values are always UTC, but are displayed to the user in a
                timezone defined by the value of a graph attribute called "time_zone" of type "time_zone"
                which defaults to 'UTC'.
            </dd>
            <dt>float</dt>
            <dd>
                A floating point number. This is represented internally as a Java IEEE-754 32-bit
                float.</dd>
            <dt>icon</dt>
            <dd>
                The name of an icon. Note that icon names need not be fully qualified, so
                'Background.Round Circle' and 'Round Circle' both represent the same icon.
            </dd>
            <dt>integer</dt>
            <dd>
                An integer. This is represented internally as a Java 32-bit signed integer.
            </dd>
            <dt>string</dt>
            <dd>A text string.</dd>
            <dt>time</dt>
            <dd>
                A time. The representation is ISO 8601 format: "hh:mm:ss".
            </dd>
            <dt>time_zone</dt>
            <dd>
                A time zone. The representation is a string accepted by the Java TimeZone class. This
                is typically a string of the form "Canberra/Australia" or "GMT+10".
            </dd>
        </dl>

        <h3>graph section</h3>

        <p>
            An example JSON document section is shown below.
        </p>

        <pre>
            "graph" : [ {
              "attrs" : [ {
                "label" : "color",
                "type" : "color",
                "descr" : "The background color of the graph",
                "default" : "Black",
                "mod_count" : 0
              }, {
                "label" : "time_zone",
                "type" : "time_zone",
                "descr" : "time_zone",
                "default" : "UTC",
                "mod_count" : 0
              } ]
            }, {
              "data" : [ { } ]
            } ]
        </pre>

        <p>
            Attributes are defined in the 'attrs' object as an array of objects, in Python
            terms, a list of dictionaries. (Although arrays have order, no ordering is imposed
            by CONSTELLATION.) Each object has four defined name/value pairs in no particular order.
        </p>

        <dl>
            <dt>label</dt>
            <dd>The user-visible name of the attribute.</dd>
            <dt>type></dt>
            <dd>The type of the attribute. See below for defined types.</dd>
            <dt>descr</dt>
            <dd>The user-visible description of the attribute.</dd>
            <dt>default</dt>
            <dd>The default value of the attribute</dd>
        </dl>

        <p>
            Data are stored in the 'data' object. In this case, no data have been stored,
            so the defaults defined in the attributes will be used; for instance, the graph
            will used the default black background.
        </p>

        <h3>vertex section</h3>

        <p>
            A part of an example 'vertex' section is shown below.
        </p>

        <pre>
            "vertex" : [ {
              "attrs" : [ {
                "label" : "x",
                "type" : "float",
                "descr" : "The x coordinate of the vertex",
                "default" : 0.0
              }, {
                "label" : "icon",
                "type" : "icon",
                "descr" : "The icon of the vertex",
                "default" : ""
              }, {
                "label" : "Name",
                "type" : "string"
              } ]
            }, {
              "data" : [ {
                "vx_id_" : 0,
                "x" : 9.760799,
                "icon" : "Flag.Australia",
                "Name" : "Node 0"
              }, {
                "vx_id_" : 1,
                "x" : 0.22238255,
                "icon" : "Misc.Constellation",
                "Name" : "Node 1"
              } ]
            } ]
        </pre>

        <p>
            In this example, three vertex attributes are defined in the 'attrs' section: 'x' (type float),
            'icon' (type icon), 'Name' (type string). Note that 'Name' has no defined 'descr' or 'default'
            values, so these will be null. Two vertices are defined in the 'data' section with specific values
            assigned to their attributes.
        <p>

        <p>The vertices define values for a special attribute.

        <dl>
            <dt>vx_id_</dt>
            <dd>
                An integer that is used as a key for each vertex in the file. The
                values need not be consecutive or ordered, but they must be unique.
            </dd>
        </dl>

        <h3>transaction section</h3>

        <p>
            This section is optional. If there is no 'transaction' section, there will be no transactions
            in the resulting graph.
        </p>

        <p>
            A part of an example 'transaction' section is shown below.
        </p>

        <pre>
            "transaction" : [ {
              "attrs" : [ {
                "label" : "color",
                "type" : "color",
                "descr" : "The color of the transaction"
              }, {
                "label" : "line_style",
                "type" : "line_style",
                "descr" : "The line style of the transaction",
                "default" : "SOLID"
              } ]
            }, {
              "data" : [ {
                "vx_src_" : 8,
                "vx_dst_" : 9,

                "Datetime" : "2014-03-21 06:15:48.471",
                "Id" : "6"
              }, {
                "vx_src_" : 5,
                "vx_dst_" : 9,

                "Id" : "918"
              } ]
            } ]
        </pre>

        <p>
            Two transaction attributes are defined in the 'attrs' section: 'color' (type color), 'line_style' (type line_style). 
            Note that 'color' has no defined 'default' value, so transactions without an explicitly defined color will be null. 
            Two transactions are defined in the 'data' section with specific values assigned to their attributes.
        <p>

        <p>
            The transactions define values for three special attributes.
        </p>

        <dl>
            <dt>vx_src_</dt>
            <dd>
                The source vertex of the transaction. This must be one of the vx_id_
                integer values defined in the vertex section.
            </dd>
            <dt>vx_dst_</dt>
            <dd>
                The destination vertex of the transaction. This must be one of the vx_id_
                integer values defined in the vertex section.
            </dd>
            <dt>tx_dir_</dt>
            <dd>
                A boolean indicating whether the transaction is directed or undirected.
                If true, the transaction is directed.
            </dd>
        </dl>

        <h3>meta section</h3>

        <p>
            This section is optional. If there is no 'meta' sections, defaults will be used.
        </p>

        <p>
            The 'meta' section contains data about the graph's environment. The data is defined by
            various CONSTELLATION modules which write their state to the JSON document on save, and read their
            state from the JSON document on open.
        </p>

        <p>
            Although the 'meta' section has the same 'attrs'+'data' format as the other sections, the
            attributes are defined by modules, rather than being built-in types. For instance, the module that
            defines which attribute values are displayed as labels on icons saves its state in the attribute
            'labels' of type 'labels'. When the document is opened, the CONSTELLATION graph opener will find
            a 'labels' attribute and advertise it to the current modules. The module responsible for labels
            will recognise the attribute, claim it, and read its state.
        </p>

        <p>
            The data section array contains a single object, with each key having a name corresponding to
            an attribute name. For instance, the module responsible for labels will have a 'labels' key in
            which its state is saved.
        </p>

        <p>
            Generally, the format of the data used by individual modules is documented by the modules,
            rather than CONSTELLATION itself. Some modules may consider their data to be for internal use only,
            and not document their format.
        </p>

        <h4>Labels</h4>

        <p>
            The 'labels' object contains the following name/value pairs.
        </p>

        <dl>
            <dt>bottom</dt>
            <dd>
                Defines the labels that appear below the icons. The value is an array of objects.
                Each object has the following name/value pairs.
                <ul>
                    <li>attr - the name of the attribute to be displayed</li>
                    <li>color - the color of the displayed characters</li>
                    <li>radius - the size of the displayed characters, defaulting to 1</li>
                </ul>
            </dd>
            <dt>top</dt>
            <dd>Defines the labels that appear above the icons. See bottom for details.</dd>
            <dt>connections</dt>
            <dd>Defines the labels that appear on the lines between nodes. See bottom for details.</dd>
            <dt>nw,ne,se,sw</dt>
            <dd>
                Defines the decorators that are drawn on icons at the specified corners. The value is
                a string that contains the name of the attribute which in turn contains the label of
                an icon. For instance, if 'IsValid' is a boolean attribute, then '"nw" : "IsValid"' will
                display the icon for "True" or "False" in the north-west corner of each icon.
