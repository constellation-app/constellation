/**
 * A DuplicateKeyException is thrown when two elements of the same type are
 * discovered in a graph that have identical values for their primary keys.
 * There are two situations when this condition is checked for allowing this
 * exception to be thrown. The most common situation occurs when a commit occurs
 * at which stage the graph automatically checks for duplicate keys and throws
 * an exception as appropriate. If an exception is thrown, all changes that are
 * part of the commit will be rolled back. The other situation where a primary
 * key check is performed is when a plugin explicitly requests it by calling {@link GraphWriteMethods#validateKey(au.gov.asd.tac.constellation.graph.GraphElementType, boolean)
 * }
 * or {@link GraphWriteMethods#validateKey(au.gov.asd.tac.constellation.graph.GraphElementType, int, boolean)
 * }. At all other times, such as during a graph transaction, duplicate keys are
 * allowed and no exception will be thrown.
