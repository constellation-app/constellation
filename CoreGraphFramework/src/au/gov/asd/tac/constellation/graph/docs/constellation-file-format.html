        <h1>The Constellation File Format</h1>

        <p>
            Constellation saves graphs in a ".star" file. This is simply a container in zip format that holds the graph file 
            "graph.txt" and optionally other files, such as node icons.
        </p>

        <p>
            This file format is also used when a graph is exported to JSON. There are two differences between saving and exporting:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                A graph is saved in a zip file with the JSON representation in a zip file entry called "graph.txt". A graph is 
                exported to a file called "name.json", with ancillary files named using UUIDs.
            </li>
            <li>
                A saved graph (in a .star file) does not contain entries for element values where the values are equal to the 
                element's default value. For instance, if the element "color" has a default of "red", then elements where the color 
                value is red will not have that value written to the file. This can result in significant space saving when writing 
                and when the file is read, can result in a significant time saving. An exported graph will contain all values of all 
                elements.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Other than these two differences, the description below applies to both variations.
        </p>

        <h2>graph.txt (or name.json)</h2>
        <p>
            The "graph.txt" (or "name.json") file contains data in UTF-8 encoded JSON format that represents a graph. To extract the 
            data manually, an unzip utility can be used. The simplest way of doing this in Windows is to append ".zip" to the 
            filename (so the file type is recognised) and double-click on the file in Windows Explorer.
        </p>

        <p>
            Because the storage format is JSON, any language with a JSON parser can read the graph. In particular, Python can be 
            used to read and write a JSON file in a zip container.
        </p>

        <p>
            The output shown below from a Python script demonstrates the top-level structure of a JSON document that describes a 
            Constellation graph:
        </p>
        <pre>
            [ { u'attribute_mod_count': 65,
                u'global_mod_count': 591,
                u'schema': u'au.gov.asd.tac.constellation.schema.InteractiveSchemaFactory',
                u'structure_mod_count': 65,
                u'version': 1},
              { u'graph': [{ u'attrs': [...]}, { u'data': [...]}]},
              { u'vertex': [{ u'attrs': [...]}, { u'data': [...]}]},
              { u'transaction': [{ u'attrs': [...]}, { u'data': [...]}]},
              { u'meta': [{ u'attrs': [...]}, { u'data': [...]}]}]
        </pre>
        <p>
            Furthermore, Constellation encodes the JSON document in "pretty-printed" style, so it is possible to use simple tools 
            such as grep(1) to search for text.
        </p>

        <h2>graph.txt (or name.json) Sections</h2>
        <p>
            The outermost structure of the graph is an ordered list containing five elements. Each element(apart from "version") 
            contains a dictionary with a single key defining the graph section contained in that element. The sections must appear 
            in the following order:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li><em>version</em> - 
                An integer version number that defines the remaining structure. This section may also contain other unspecified data.
            </li>
            <li><em>graph</em> - 
                Contains data relevant to the graph (e.g. background colour).
            </li>
            <li><em>vertex</em> - 
                Contains data relevant to the nodes (e.g. the name of the node).
            </li>
            <li><em>transaction</em> - 
                Contains data relevant to the transactions (e.g. line style).
            </li>
            <li><em>meta</em> - 
                Contains data about the graph environment (e.g. the attributes used for displaying labels).
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Why do it like this? Why not just a use a top-level dictionary containing the section keys? Unlike XML, JSON objects 
            contain unordered name/value pairs. This means that (for example) when a Python dictionary is serialised, the 
            "transaction" key might appear before the "vertex" key in the resulting JSON. Since transactions can't be added to the
            graph before their corresponding nodes, this would require that the entire structure be loaded into memory to ensure 
            that "vertex" could be accessed first, which would not be a good idea for large graphs.
        </p>
        <p>
            By making the top-level structure a JSON array with a specified order, the data can be streamed from the file in the 
            required order, making graph reading more efficient.
        </p>
        <p>
            Given that the order is defined, putting a JSON object with a single name in each element is superfluous. However, the 
            name provides a built-in level of documentation, making the file (slightly) more readable, and adds little overhead when 
            reading and writing the file.
        </p>

        <p>
            Each graph section "graph", "vertex", "transaction", "meta" contains data with the same format: a list of two 
            single-named objects.
        </p>

        <p>
            (The structure here is a list of single-named dictionaries, rather than a single dictionary with two names, for the same 
            reason that the top-most structure is a list of single-named dictionaries: the attributes must be defined before they 
            can be used):
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><em>attrs</em> - 
                Defines the attributes used by this section of the graph. The value of this object is an array of objects, where 
                each object is an attribute definition.
            </li>
            <li><em>data</em> - 
                Defines the data in this section of the graph. The value of this object is an array of objects, where each object is 
                a graph datum corresponding to the current section of the document.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            If an object does not define a name, the value of that name is assumed to be null. e.g. if the vertex "attrs" section 
            defines a "Country" attribute, and an object in the vertex "data" section has no "Country" name, then the resulting
            graph will have a "Country" value of null.
        </p>

        <h2>Attributes</h2>
        <p>
            Attributes define the data values that are attached to elements of the graph. Each attribute has four components:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><em>label</em> - The name of the attribute.</li>
            <li><em>type</em> - The type of attribute (see below).</li>
            <li><em>descr</em> - A description of the attribute. (Optional)</li>
            <li><em>default</em> - The default value. (Optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Attributes are defined separately in each graph section; an attribute defined in the "vertex" section cannot be used in 
            the "transaction" section.
        </p>

        <h2>Data Types</h2>
        <p>
            Constellation defines some built-in data types. These are listed below.
        </p>
        <p>
            All data type values have string representations so they can be round-tripped from their internal representation, to a 
            JSON document when saved, and back to their internal representation when loaded (although some floating point numbers 
            may not be retrieved exactly due to the inexactness inherent in the string representation). (Obviously this 
            round-tripping would work for other string formats such as CSV):
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><em>boolean</em> - 
                A true/false value, represented by the strings "true" and "false".
            </li>
            <li><em>blaze</em> - 
                A node marker. The string representation has the format "angle;color;icon;isDisplayed".
                <ul>
                    <li>angle - degrees clockwise from 12 o'clock</li>
                    <li>color - see color type</li>
                    <li>icon - see icon type</li>
                    <li>isDisplayed - true or false indicating whether the blaze is displayed or not.
                </ul>
                e.g. "45;LightBlue;Sphere_48;true".
            </li>
            <li><em>color</em> - 
                An RGBA colour. This value has two representations: a name ("red", "green", "blue", ...), or a comma-separated list 
                of four floating-point numbers between 0 and 1 inclusive representing the red, green, blue, and alpha components of 
                the colour. The alpha component is optional; if it is not present, it defaults to 1. For instance "red", "1,0,0" and
                "1,0,0,1" are equivalent, as are "DarkGreen" and "0,0.5,0". Note that the alpha component is often ignored by 
                Constellation; for instance, an alpha component of 0.5 in a node color will not result in a semi-transparent 
                background icon.
            </li>
            <li><em>date</em> - 
                A date. The representation is ISO 8601 format: "YYYY-MMM-DD".
            </li>
            <li><em>datetime</em> - 
                A datetime. The representation is ISO 8601 format with 'T' replaced by ' ': "YYYY-MMM-DD hh:mm:ss". Datetime values 
                are always UTC, but are displayed to the user in a timezone defined by the value of a graph attribute called 
                "time_zone" of type "time_zone" which defaults to "UTC".
            </li>
            <li><em>float</em> - 
                A floating point number. This is represented internally as a Java IEEE-754 32-bit float.
            </li>
            <li><em>icon</em> - 
                The name of an icon. Note that icon names need not be fully qualified, so "Background.Round Circle" and 
                "Round Circle" both represent the same icon.
            </li>
            <li><em>integer</em> - 
                An integer. This is represented internally as a Java 32-bit signed integer.
            </li>
            <li><em>string</em> - 
                A text string.
            </li>
            <li><em>time</em> - 
                A time. The representation is ISO 8601 format: "hh:mm:ss".
            </li>
            <li><em>time_zone</em> - 
                A time zone. The representation is a string accepted by the Java TimeZone class. This is typically a string of the 
                form "Canberra/Australia" or "GMT+10".
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>"graph" Section</h2>
        <p>
            An example JSON document section is shown below:
        </p>
        <pre>
            "graph" : [ {
              "attrs" : [ {
                "label" : "color",
                "type" : "color",
                "descr" : "The background color of the graph",
                "default" : "Black",
                "mod_count" : 0
              }, {
                "label" : "time_zone",
                "type" : "time_zone",
                "descr" : "time_zone",
                "default" : "UTC",
                "mod_count" : 0
              } ]
            }, {
              "data" : [ { } ]
            } ]
        </pre>
        <p>
            Attributes are defined in the "attrs" object as an array of objects, in Python terms, a list of dictionaries. (Although 
            arrays have order, no ordering is imposed by Constellation.) Each object has four defined name/value pairs in no 
            particular order.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><em>label</em> - The user-visible name of the attribute.</li>
            <li><em>type</em> - The type of the attribute. See below for defined types.</li>
            <li><em>descr</em> - The user-visible description of the attribute.</li>
            <li><em>default</em> - The default value of the attribute</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Data are stored in the "data" object. In this case, no data have been stored, so the defaults defined in the attributes 
            will be used (e.g. the graph will use the default black background).
        </p>

        <h2>"vertex" Section</h2>
        <p>
            A part of an example "vertex" section is shown below:
        </p>
        <pre>
            "vertex" : [ {
              "attrs" : [ {
                "label" : "x",
                "type" : "float",
                "descr" : "The x coordinate of the vertex",
                "default" : 0.0
              }, {
                "label" : "icon",
                "type" : "icon",
                "descr" : "The icon of the vertex",
                "default" : ""
              }, {
                "label" : "Name",
                "type" : "string"
              } ]
            }, {
              "data" : [ {
                "vx_id_" : 0,
                "x" : 9.760799,
                "icon" : "Flag.Australia",
                "Name" : "Node 0"
              }, {
                "vx_id_" : 1,
                "x" : 0.22238255,
                "icon" : "Misc.Constellation",
                "Name" : "Node 1"
              } ]
            } ]
        </pre>
        <p>
            In this example, three vertex attributes are defined in the "attrs" section: "x" (type float), "icon" (type icon), and  
            "Name" (type string). 
            <br />
            NOTE: "Name" has no defined "descr" or "default" values, so these will be null. Two vertices are defined in the "data" 
            section with specific values assigned to their attributes.
        <p>
        <p>
            The vertices define values for a special attribute:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><em>vx_id_</em> - 
                An integer that is used as a key for each vertex in the file. The values need not be consecutive or ordered, but 
                they must be unique.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>"transaction" Section</h2>
        <p>
            This section is optional. If there is no "transaction" section, there will be no transactions in the resulting graph.
        </p>
        <p>
            A part of an example "transaction" section is shown below.
        </p>
        <pre>
            "transaction" : [ {
              "attrs" : [ {
                "label" : "color",
                "type" : "color",
                "descr" : "The color of the transaction"
              }, {
                "label" : "line_style",
                "type" : "line_style",
                "descr" : "The line style of the transaction",
                "default" : "SOLID"
              } ]
            }, {
              "data" : [ {
                "vx_src_" : 8,
                "vx_dst_" : 9,
                "tx_dir_" : true,
                "color" : "0.27553296,0.79927653,0.2556097,1.0",
                "line_style" : "SOLID",
                "Datetime" : "2014-03-21 06:15:48.471",
                "Id" : "6"
              }, {
                "vx_src_" : 5,
                "vx_dst_" : 9,
                "tx_dir_" : true,
                "color" : "0.7740898,0.7625852,0.9571049,1.0",
                "visibility" : 0.11111111,
                "line_style" : "SOLID",
                "Datetime" : "2014-03-22 04:42:31.216",
                "Id" : "918"
              } ]
            } ]
        </pre>
        <p>
            Two transaction attributes are defined in the "attrs" section: "color" (type color), and "line_style" (type line_style).
            <br />
            NOTE: "color" has no defined 'default' value, so transactions without an explicitly defined color will be null. 
            Two transactions are defined in the 'data' section with specific values assigned to their attributes.
        </p>
        <p>
            The transactions define values for three special attributes:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><em>vx_src_</em> - 
                The source vertex of the transaction. This must be one of the vx_id_ integer values defined in the vertex section.
            </li>
            <li><em>vx_dst_</em> - 
                The destination vertex of the transaction. This must be one of the vx_id_ integer values defined in the vertex
                section.
            </li>
            <li><em>tx_dir_</em> - 
                A boolean indicating whether the transaction is directed or undirected. If true, the transaction is directed.

        <h2>"meta" Section</h2>
        <p>
            This section is optional. If there is no "meta" section, defaults will be used.
        </p>
        <p>
            The "meta" section contains data about the graph's environment. The data is defined by various Constellation modules 
            which write their state to the JSON document on save, and read their state from the JSON document on open.
        </p>
        <p>
            Although the "meta" section has the same "attrs"+"data" format as the other sections, the attributes are defined by 
            modules, rather than being built-in types. For instance, the module that defines which attribute values are displayed as 
            labels on icons saves its state in the attribute "labels" of type "labels". When the document is opened, the 
            Constellation graph opener will find a "labels" attribute and advertise it to the current modules. The module 
            responsible for labels will recognise the attribute, claim it, and read its state.
        </p>
        <p>
            The data section array contains a single object, with each key having a name corresponding to an attribute name. For 
            instance, the module responsible for labels will have a "labels" key in which its state is saved.
        </p>
        <p>
            Generally, the format of the data used by individual modules is documented by the modules, rather than Constellation 
            itself. Some modules may consider their data to be for internal use only, and not document their format.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Labels</h3>
        <p>
            The "labels" object contains the following name/value pairs:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><em>bottom</em> - 
                Defines the labels that appear below the icons. The value is an array of objects. Each object has the following 
                name/value pairs:
                <ul>
                    <li><em>attr</em> - the name of the attribute to be displayed</li>
                    <li><em>color</em> - the color of the displayed characters</li>
                    <li><em>radius</em> - the size of the displayed characters, defaulting to 1</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><em>top</em> - Defines the labels that appear above the icons. See bottom for details.</li>
            <li><em>connections</em> - Defines the labels that appear on the lines between nodes. See bottom for details.</li>
            <li><em>nw,ne,se,sw</em> - 
                Defines the decorators that are drawn on icons at the specified corners. The value is a string that contains the 
                name of the attribute which in turn contains the label of an icon. For instance, if "IsValid" is a boolean attribute, 
                then '"nw" : "IsValid"' will display the icon for "True" or "False" in the north-west corner of each icon.
            </li>
        </ul>
