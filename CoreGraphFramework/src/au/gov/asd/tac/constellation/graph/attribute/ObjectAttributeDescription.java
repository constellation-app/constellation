 * This describes a type of attribute whose values are arbitrary objects. This

 * <p>
 * Attribute values may be set in any matter or retrieved in any manner, where
 * in the later case they are explicitly cast (without checking) to the required
 * type. Note that in many cases this is not desired behaviour and so
 * descriptions which extend this class will need to explicitly override these
 * methods to throw an {@link IllegalArgumentException}. This may be changed in
 * the future.
