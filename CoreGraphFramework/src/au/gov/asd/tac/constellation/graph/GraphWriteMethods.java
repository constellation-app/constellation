     * custom {@link GraphOperation} object that handles the undo/redo
     * operations in a more memory efficient way.

     * IMPORTANT: This is an advanced operation and should only be used where
     * the benefits clearly outweigh the extra work and risk of taking over
     * responsibility for undo/redo. It is critical that the undo/redo
