/**
 * A Graph object represents a graph in Constellation.
 * <p>
 * Graph read/write methods are not available directly from this interface, a
 * Graph interface provides methods for acquiring read and write locks that
 * return {@link ReadableGraph} and {@link WritableGraph} interfaces
 * respectively. It is these interfaces that allow for reading and writing to a
 * graph.
 * <p>
 * The typical method for reading from a graph is as follows:
 * <pre><code>
 *      // Acqure a read lock on the graph
 *      ReadableGraph rg = graph.getReadableGraph();
 *
 *      try {
 *          // All reading operations should happen inside a try/catch
 *          final int vertexCount = rg.getVertexCount();
 *          ...
 *      } finally {
 *          // The read lock should be released inside a finally block
 *          rg.release()
 *      }
 *      // The read lock is now released - read operations are now not allowed
 * </code></pre>
 * <p>
 * The typical method for writing to a graph is as follows:
 * <pre><code>
 *      // Acqure a write lock on the graph
 *      WritableGraph wg = graph.getWritableGraph("Add A Vertex", true);
 *
 *      try {
 *          // All writing operations should happen inside a try/catch
 *          final int newVertex = wg.addVertex();
 *          ...
 *      } finally {
 *          // The write lock should be committed inside a finally block
 *          wg.commit()
 *      }
 *      // The write lock is now released - read and write operations are now not allowed
 * </code></pre>
 * <p>
 * NOTE: This graph maintains the equality that the sum of degrees of all
 * vertices = 2 * the number of links. This causes a few counter-intuitive
 * results such as:
 * <ol>
 * <li>When a loop is created, the degree of a vertex increases by 2.
 * <li>When a loop is created, the vertex is now a neighbour of itself twice.
 * <li>When a loop is created, the transaction, edge and link counts are also
 * increased by 2.
 * </ol>
