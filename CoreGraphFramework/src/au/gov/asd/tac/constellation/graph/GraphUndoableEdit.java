/**
 * A GraphUndoableEdit encapsulates a sequence of changes to a graph.
 * <p>
 * An edit is obtained from a Graph by calling {@code createNewEdit()}. Once
 * created, an edit remains active on the graph until {@code finish()} is
 * called. The edit may be paused and resumed if required: for instance,
 * multiple changes to the same attribute are redundant, and would use
 * significant resources.
 * <p>
 * Example code is shown below. Note that if no changes were actually made, it
 * is not necessary to call edit.undo() because there is nothing to undo. Be
 * careful; if changes were made, and edit.undo() isn't called, then the changes
 * to the graph won't be undone, an there will be no undo available to undo to
 * the graph's previous state.
 *
 * <pre>
 * <code>
 * graph.getWriteLock();
 * final GraphUndoableEdit edit = graph.createNewEdit("Brief reason for editing", true);
 * try {
 *     // Make changes  to graph.
 * } finally {
 *     edit.finish();
 *     graph.releaseWriteLock();
 * }
 *
 * if (rollback) {
 *     edit.undo();
 *     edit.die();
 * } else {
 *     undoRedoManager.undoableEditHappened(new UndoableEditEvent(graph, edit));
