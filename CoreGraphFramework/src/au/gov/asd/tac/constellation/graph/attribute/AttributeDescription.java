/**
 * An AttributeDescription defines an attribute type that can hold a new type of
 * value, such as integers, booleans, colors etc. This interface hides the
 * actual data stored by the attribute behind a collection of getter and setter
 * methods meaning that the attribute designer has a lot of freedom to store the
 * data in an efficient manner.
 * <p>
 * Every attribute must work with #getObject and #getString. Everything else is
 * optional. This means that comparison of values, #getObject and #getString are
 * the safest choice.
 * <p>
 * Access to the attribute values held by this AttributeDescription are accessed
 * by a collection of getter/setter pairs covering all the primitive types as
 * well as Objects and Strings. The general principle is that these
 * getter/setter pairs should operate in a consistent way.
 * <p>
 * A getter method must either provide a version of its underlying value in the
 * requested form or throw an {@link IllegalArgumentException}. However, if it
 * chooses to return a value, this value must be accepted by the corresponding
 * setter method and calling the setter method must return the underlying native
 * value to the same state it was in when the getter was called.
