/**
 * This package implements the low level data structures required to store and
 * manipulate a graph.
 * <p>
 * The Graph has no knowledge of a schema and does not rely on it. However,
 * since a schema is (nearly) always used by everything that uses a Graph, the
 * Graph module seems a reasonable place to put the schema stuff.
