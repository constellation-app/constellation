 * In general, the graph aims to be completely generic in terms of the data it
 * holds, providing only the ability to add attributes to graph elements with no
 * specific help to the user regarding their specific use case.
 *
 * Each graph has an attached schema that is given the opportunity to modify the
 * graph at specific times in the graph's life cycle in order to customise the
 * graph for a specific use case. These times include when the graph is created,
 * when a new element is created or removed, or when an element has finished
 * being configured.
