/**
 * An interface for a data structure consisting of multiple records, each of
 * which is a key-value map of Strings. The union of key sets across the records
 * can be thought of as columns, while the records themselves can be though of
 * rows, hence this can be imagined and implemented as a sparse table.
 * <p>
 * Note that RecordStore extends the Record interface. There is no requirement
 * for an implementation of RecordStore to use an implementation of the Record
 * interface to store each row. However, calling Record methods on a RecordStore
 * should be equivalent to calling the same method on the current row as if it
 * were an implementation of Record.
 * <p>
 * RecordStore is typically used as an interchange format between graphs and
 * plugins that require, or return, a tabular view of a graph. It is also a
 * convenient way of representing the data in a graph independently from the
 * graph implementation, and so is often used to copy data between graphs.
 * <p>
 * A common task with RecordStore is iterating through its list of records and
 * getting or setting various key/value pairs. A simple example of this workflow
 * is as follows:
 *
 * <pre>
 * <code>
 * recordStore.reset();
 * while (recordStore.next()) {
 *      String value = recordStore.get(key); // Get the value for a given key
 *      value = doSomething(value); // process the value in some way
 *      recordStore.set(key, value); // set the updated value for the given key
 * }
 * </code>
 * </pre>
