        <h2>The CONSTELLATION Graph Model</h2>
        <p>
            The diagram below shows the components of a graph.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                A transaction represents an interaction between two nodes; it can be directed from node 1 to node 2, directed from node 2 to node 1, 
                or undirected. There can be multiple transactions between two nodes.
            </li>
            <li>
                An edge is the collection of transactions in a single direction between two nodes. Because there are only three directions
                (as described above), there can only be up to three edges between two nodes.
            </li>
            <li>
                A link is the collection of edges (and therefore transactions) between two nodes. There can be no more than one link between two nodes.
                A link has no direction.
            </li>
        </ul>
