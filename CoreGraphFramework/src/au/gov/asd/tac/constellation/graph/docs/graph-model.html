            The diagram below shows the components of a graph:

        <p>
            A transaction represents an interaction between two nodes; it can be directed (from node 1 to node 2 or vise-versa) or 
            undirected. There can be multiple transactions between two nodes.
        </p>
        <p>
            An edge is the collection of transactions in a single direction between two nodes. Because there are only three 
            directions (as described above), there can only be up to three edges between two nodes.
        </p>
        <p>
            A link is the collection of edges (and therefore transactions) between two nodes. There can be no more than one link 
            between two nodes. A link has no direction.
