/**
 * The GraphReadMethods provides an API that allows read-only access to the
 * graph. {@link GraphWriteMethods} extends GraphReadMethods and provides
 * methods that allow modification of the graph.
 *
 * <h3>Graph ID</h3>
 * Each graph is allocated an ID when it is created. The default behavior is to
 * assign each graph an ID that is unique with in the application so that it can
 * be used to identify the graph through its lifetime. However, there are
 * methods to copy a graph which preserves its ID and therefore creates the
 * situation where multiple graphs share a single ID. It is advised that these
 * graphs be used exclusively for private purposes and not exposed globally to
 * the application to preserve the uniqueness of the IDs.
 *
 * <h3>Graph Schema</h3>
 * In its basic form, the graph is a very generic structure providing attribute
 * graph elements with no context or functionality specific to any domain. While
 * this provides great flexibility, it makes working in specific domains harder
 * and more manual. Each graph has an associated schema that has the
 * responsibility of adding a layer of domain specific context over the top of
 * the generic graph structure. It is provided with an opportunity at various
 * stages in the graph's life cycle, such as when the graph is created, or when
 * graph elements are added or removed, to make domain specific changes to the
 * graph. Every graph must have an assigned schema at all times. However, the
 * default schema does nothing and is effectively equivalent to having no
 * schema.
 *
 * <h3>Graph Elements</h3>
 * A graph is comprised of sets of 5 different elements:
 * <ol>
 * <li>Vertices: vertices (or nodes) of the graph are connected together by
 * transactions. Where this occurs, the two vertices are considered to be
 * neighbors.</li>
 * <li>Transactions: transactions connect two vertices and can be either
 * directed or undirected. There can be many transactions between a single pair
 * of vertices.</li>
 * <li>Edges: an edge also connects a pair of vertices and represents all
 * transactions between those two vertices oriented in a single direction (or
 * undirected). Edges are not created explicity but are created and removed
 * automatically by the graph as transactions are created and deleted. By
 * definition, there can be at most 3 edges between any pair of vertices, one
 * representing transactions in the forward direction, one representing
 * transactions in the reverse direction, and one representing undirected
 * transactions.</li>
 * <li>Links: a link also connects a pair of vertices and represents all
 * transactions between those two vertices, regardless of direction. Links are
 * also not created explicitly but are created and deleted as transactions are
 * added and removed from the graph. By definition, there can be at most one
 * link between any pair of vertices. This link will exist only if there is at
 * least one transaction between the pair of vertices.</li>
 * <li>Attributes: attributes are associated with one of the other elements
 * types and allow values to be stored against each element of that type. Each
 * attribute has a type specifying the type of data that can be stored.</li>
 * </ol>
 * The graph contains methods that allow traversal of their relationships
 * between elements in the graph, for example:
 * <ol>
 * <li>Find all transactions adjacent to a vertex and find the
 * source/destination vertex for a transaction</li>
 * <li>Find all edges represented by a link and find the link representing an
 * edge.</li>
 * <li>Find all attributes associated with a vertex and find the element type
 * that an attribute is associated with.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <h3>Element IDs</h3>
 * Each element is referenced by a unique integer ID that is allocated to the
 * element on creation and guaranteed not to change while the element exists. At
 * any point in time, the graph will have an capacity for a given element type
 * specifying the number of those elements the graph can hold. The IDs of those
 * elements will be allocated from the range of 0 (inclusive) to capacity
 * (exclusive). The capacity for a given element type is automatically expanded
 * as new elements are created. It is important to note that the ID of a deleted
 * element my be allocated to a new element when it is created.
 *
 * <h3>Element Positions</h3>
 * Each element also has a position number specifying the position that element
 * holds in the list of all elements of that type. While no elements of that
 * type are added or deleted, this position number will remain constant.
 * However, if a new element is added or removed, the graph is free to rearrange
 * those elements as needed by the implementation. If the graph holds N elements
 * of a given type, it is guaranteed that each element will hold a unique
 * position number between 0 (inclusive) and N (exclusive). This means that it
 * is possible to iterate through all elements of a given type by looking up the
 * element holding each positions between 0 and the count of those elements,
 * assuming that no elements are added or removed during the iterations.
 *
 * <h3>Element UIDs</h3>
 * Each element also has a UID which, unlike its ID, is guaranteed never to be
 * used for another element of that type for the life of the graph. This can be
 * useful to detect when an element has been deleted and another element created
 * using the same ID.
 *
 * <h3>Modification Counters</h3>
 * Changes on the graph are recorded through a series of modification counters:
 * <ol>
 * <li>Global Modification Counter: this counter is incremented each time any
 * change is made to the graph. If this modification counter has not changed
 * then it can be guaranteed that the graph has not changed in any way.</li>
 * <li>Structure Modification Counter: this counter is incremented each time a
 * vertex or transaction is added or removed from the graph. </li>
 * <li>Attribute Modification Counter: this counter is incremented each time an
 * attribute is added or removed from the graph.</li>
 * <li>Attribute Value Modification Counters: there is one attribute
 * modification counter for each attribute on the graph. These modification
 * counters get incremented each time a change is made to the value of that
 * attribute for any element.</li>
 * </ol>
 * When undo operations occur, the counters are decremented to be identical to
 * the values that existed before the original operation occurred. Therefore, if
 * attempting to detect changes in the graph, it is important that a test for
 * inequality is performed, rather than testing for a modification counter that
 * is greater than previously seen.
 *
 * <h3>Undo/Redo</h3>
 * The graph automatically records all operations performed on it to allow for
 * undo/redo functionality. In some cases, the default storage of the undo/redo
 * information is not memory efficient so the API allows for the execution of a
 * GraphOperation that is responsible for both the initial modification, as well
 * as any subsequent undo/redo operations. This should be treated as an advanced
 * functionality with much risk involved and should be only considered in cases
 * where a substantial memory saving can be achieved. It is critical that the
 * GraphOperation return the graph to the exact previous state when an undo (or
 * redo) operation is requested to prevent the graph becoming corrupted.
 *
 * <h3>Primary Keys</h3>
 * Each element type, particularly vertices and transactions, can have one or
 * more of their attributes specified as their primary key attributes. If no
 * primary key is specified for a given element type then attributes of that
 * type can be modified as required with the graph taking no action. If a
 * primary key is specified then the graph ensures that no to elements of that
 * type exist at the same time with the same combination of primary key
 * attribute values. It does this by keeping a list of elements that have had
 * primary key attribute changes since the last graph commit. Before a commit
 * can occur, each of these elements is validated to make sure its primary key
 * attribute values do not clash with other elements of its type. If a clash is
 * discovered, the graph's merger is given an opportunity to resolve the clash
 * by merging the two elements. If this is not possible, a DuplicateKeyException
 * is thrown and any uncommitted changes are rolled back. Only performing this
 * validation step on commit allows elements to temporarily share key attribute
 * values during the process of an edit, as long as those clashes are resolved
 * before the commit. There are also methods to manually enforce a primary key
 * validation if required.
 *
 * <h3>Immutable Attribute Values</h3>
 * It is important that all attribute values are considered immutable. This
 * happens by default when the underlying native attribute value is either a
 * primitive or a String. However, when the value is an Object, it is important
 * that values sourced from the graph are not simply edited and then set again
 * on the graph.
 * <p>
 * This is incorrect and will cause the graph to become corrupt:
 * <pre><code>
 *      Object value = graph.getObjectValue(attributeId, elementId);
 *      value.setSomething(...);
 *      graph.setObjectValue(attributeId, elementId, value);
 * </code></pre>
 *
 * This is correct:
 * <pre><code>
 *      Object value = graph.getObjectValue(attributeId, elementId);
 *      Object newValue = new Value(value);
 *      newValue.setSomething(...);
 *      graph.setObjectValue(attributeId, elementId, newValue);
 * </code></pre>
