 * itself has a {@link JsonNode} corresponding to it. Graph attributes need to
 * read and write their values for these elements as child-nodes of the nodes
 * corresponding to the elements.

 * {@link au.gov.asd.tac.constellation.graph.attribute.AttributeDescription} and
 * AbstractGraphIOProvider.
 * <p>
 * Note that all necessary graph locking when reading and writing is handled by
 * the framework that utilises these providers.
