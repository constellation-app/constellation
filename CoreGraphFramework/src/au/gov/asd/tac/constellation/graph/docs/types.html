        <h1>Types</h1>

        <p>
            Nodes and transactions in Constellation can be assigned a type, which is used to both group these elements according to
            the type of data they represent, as well as to allow the graph to infer various properties about each element. Types are
            hierarchical, meaning that each type could have a parent type, as well as one or more children type. Generally, higher
            level types describe broad categories of data, while lower level types are more specific.
        </p>

        <h2>Node Types</h2>
        <p>
            Node types identify a node as belonging to a particular category of data, such as "Document" or "Person". Each node type
            holds the following properties:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <em>Name</em> - the name assigned to this type
            </li>
            <li>
                <em>Description</em> - a description of what the type is
            </li>
            <li>
                <em>Colour</em> - the colour which should be set for nodes of this type
            </li>
            <li>
                <em>Foreground Icon</em> - the foreground icon which should be set for nodes of this type
            </li>
            <li>
                <em>Background Icon</em> - the background icon which should be set for nodes of this type
            </li>
            <li>
                <em>Detection Regex</em> - the regular expression which can be used to detect identifiers of this type
            </li>
            <li>
                <em>Validation Regex</em> - the regular expression which can be used to check if vertices of this type are valid
            </li>
            <li>
                <em>Super Type</em> - the immediate parent type of this type in the type hierarchy
            </li>
            <li>
                <em>Overridden Type</em> - the type that this type overrides in the type hierarchy
            </li>
            <li>
                <em>Properties</em> - a map of additional properties of this type which are not covered by the above default properties
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Transaction Types</h2>
        <p>
            Transaction types identify a transaction as describing a particular category of relationship, such as "Correlation" or
            "Communication". Each transaction type holds the following properties:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <em>Name</em> - the name assigned to this type
            </li>
            <li>
                <em>Description</em> - a description of what the type is
            </li>
            <li>
                <em>Colour</em> - the colour which should be set for transactions of this type
            </li>
            <li>
                <em>Style</em> - the line style which should be set for transactions of this type
            </li>
            <li>
                <em>Directed</em> - whether or not transactions of this type should be directed by default
            </li>
            <li>
                <em>Super Type</em> - the immediate parent type of this type in the type hierarchy
            </li>
            <li>
                <em>Overridden Type</em> - the type that this type overrides in the type hierarchy
            </li>
            <li>
                <em>Properties</em> - a map of additional properties of this type which are not covered by the above default properties
            </li>
        </ul>
