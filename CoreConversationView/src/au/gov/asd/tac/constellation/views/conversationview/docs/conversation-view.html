        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            The Conversation View displays the text of the "Content" attribute
            of transactions selected between two nodes in a format resembling a 
            messaging application. Like a messaging application, the content is 
            ordered chronologically by the "DateTime" attribute. Only the content 
            for selected transactions with datetime values are displayed. If transactions 
            between more than two sets of unique nodes are selected then no conversation 
            text will be displayed.
        </p>
        
        <div style="text-align: center">
            <img src="resources/ConversationView.png" alt="Conversation View">
        </div>

        <p>
            The content is displayed in chat "bubbles", similar to those used by
            some smart phones and instant messaging clients. The text and time
            stamps can be selected and copied. To copy selected text, press Ctrl-C 
            or right click and use the context menu. Constellation will "beep" if 
            you use Ctrl-C but copy the text anyway. When text is selected in a 
            bubble, any text already selected in other bubbles is not automatically
            deselected however only text in the current bubble is copied.
        </p>

        <h2>Translations</h2>
        <p>
            If translated content is present in the graph (the "Content.Translated"
            transaction attribute), you can choose to view the original content, 
            the translation, or both using the buttons at the top of the window. 
            If you are viewing translations only and a particular transaction does 
            not have a translation, then the original content will be displayed
            in italics.
        </p>

        <p>
            You can enable or disable the hover translation capability available 
            for certain languages using the check box at the top of the Conversation 
            View. Disabling this will make it easier to select and copy text from 
            the window.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Adding Content attributes</h2>
        <p>
            The "Content" Attribute needs to be present in order to be able to use 
            the Conversation View. If it is not already there, you can click on 
            the "Add Content Attributes" button found at the top of the Conversation 
            View. This will add all of the content attributes to your graph (including 
            "Content" and "Content.Translated").
