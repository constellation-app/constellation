        <h2>Conversation Viewer</h2>
        <p>
            The conversation viewer panel displays the text of the "Content" attribute
            of transactions selected between two nodes. The content is ordered chronologically
            by the "DateTime" attribute. If links in both directions are selected
            then the content is displayed as a conversation. Content is only displayed
            for selected transactions. If transactions between more than two nodes
            are selected then no conversation text will be displayed.
        </p>

        <p>
            The content is displayed in chat "bubbles", similar to those used by
            some smart phones and instant messaging clients. The text and time
            stamps can be selected and copied. To copy selected text, press
            &lt;Control&gt;-C or right click and use the context menu. CONSTELLATION
            will "beep" if you use &lt;Control&gt;-C but copy the text anyway.
            When text is selected in a bubble,
            any text already selected in other bubbles is not automatically
            deselected however only text in the current bubble is copied.
        </p>

        <p>
            If translated content is present in the graph, you can choose to view
            the original content, the translation, or both using the buttons at the
            top of the window. If you are viewing translations only and a particular
            transaction does not have a translation, then the original content will be displayed
            in italics.
        </p>

        <p>
            You can enable or disable the hover translation capability available for certain
            languages using the check box at the bottom of the panel. Disabling
            this will make it easier to select and copy text from the window.
