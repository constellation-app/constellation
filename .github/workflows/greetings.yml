          Hello @${{ github.actor }}, thank you for submitting a PR! We will respond as soon as possible.

          Hello @${{ github.actor }}, thank you for your interest in our work!
          
          If you have a question about using Constellation then please have a read of our [Quick Start Guide](https://github.com/constellation-app/constellation/raw/master/docs/Constellation_Quick_Start_Guide.pdf).
          
          If you are a developer then it is advised to go through the [Developer Training Guide](https://github.com/constellation-app/constellation-training). 
          
          **Note:** _We have already migrated to NetBeans 12, however the examples in the training guide still reference NetBeans 8.2._
          We are working on a new version so just bear that in mind.
