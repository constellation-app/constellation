# Graph Preferences

Graph preferences can be accessed via Setup -> Options -> CONSTELLATION
-> Graph.

## Default Blaze Settings

When you add a blaze to a node, the blaze has a set size and opacity.
The default blaze size and opacity can be changed in preferences by
adjusting the relevant slider. These defaults are then applied only
after Constellation is restarted.

## Blaze Custom Colors

In Constellation, you can create a blaze of almost any colour. Most
colours have to be selected via adding a custom blaze but there are set
of default preset blaze colours that you can pick instead (namely red,
blue, and yellow). If there are blaze colours you expect to use
regularly, you can update the list of preset colours either in
preferences or via the blaze menu.

To add or update a preset colour, click on one of the ten squares (ten
is the maximum number of presets you can have) to bring up the colour
picker and select the desired colour. Once added, you will be able to
pick any preset colours from the blaze menu.
