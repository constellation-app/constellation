# Graph Preferences

Graph preferences can be accessed via Setup -> Options -> CONSTELLATION
-> Graph.

## Default Blaze Settings

When you add a blaze to a node, the blaze has a set size and opacity.
The default blaze size and opacity can be changed in preferences by
adjusting the relevant slider. These defaults are then applied only
after Constellation is restarted.

## Blaze Custom Colors

In Constellation, you can create a blaze of almost any color. Most
colors have to be selected via adding a custom blaze but there are set
of default preset blaze colors that you can pick instead (namely red,
blue, and yellow). If there are blaze colors you expect to use
regularly, you can update the list of preset colors either in
preferences or via the blaze menu.

To add or update a preset color, click on one of the ten squares (ten
is the maximum number of presets you can have) to bring up the color
picker and select the desired color. Once added, you will be able to
pick any preset colors from the blaze menu.
