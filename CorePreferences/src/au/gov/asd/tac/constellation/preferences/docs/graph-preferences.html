        <h1>Graph Preferences</h1>
        <p>
            Graph preferences can be accessed via Setup -&gt; Options -&gt; CONSTELLATION -&gt; Graph.
        </p>

        <h2>Default Blaze Settings</h2>
        <p>
            When you add a blaze to a node, the blaze has a set size and opacity. The default blaze size and opacity can be changed
            in preferences by adjusting the relevant slider. These defaults are then applied only after Constellation is restarted.
        </p>

        <h2>Blaze Custom Colors</h2>
        <p>
            In Constellation, you can create a blaze of almost any colour. Most colours have to be selected via adding a custom blaze
            but there are set of default preset blaze colours that you can pick instead (namely red, blue, and yellow). If there are
            blaze colours you expect to use regularly, you can update the list of preset colours either in preferences or via the
            blaze menu.
        </p>
        <p>
            To add or update a preset colour, click on one of the ten squares (ten is the maximum number of presets you can have) to
            bring up the colour picker and select the desired colour. Once added, you will be able to pick any preset colours from the
            blaze menu.
