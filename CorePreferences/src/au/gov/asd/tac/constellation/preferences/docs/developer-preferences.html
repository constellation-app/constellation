        <h2>Memory Usage</h2>
        <p>
            Constellation is a java application which means that the memory management is handled by the Garbage Collector (GC) 
            process inside the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). It is best left to the GC to decide when to release unused memory but we 
            can give a hint to the GC to clear unused memory when a graph is open or closed.
        </p>
        <p>
            The following options have been enabled by default and does not guarantee that any garbage collection will be performed
            because it is ultimately up to the GC process to decide. A side effect of having this enabled means that opening and 
            closing graphs could take longer to complete if the GC decides to clean up unused memory on a open or close.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Garbage Collect GC on graph open</li>
            <li>Garbage Collect GC on graph close</li>
        </ul>
