        <h1>Developer Preferences</h1>
        <p>
            Developer preferences can be accessed via Setup -&gt; Options -&gt; CONSTELLATION -&gt; Developer.
        </p>

        <h2>Memory Usage</h2>
        <p>
            Constellation is a java application which means that the memory management is handled by the Garbage Collector (GC)
            process inside the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). It is best left to the GC to decide when to release unused memory but we
            can give a hint to the GC to clear unused memory when a graph is open or closed.
        </p>
        <p>
            The following options have been enabled by default and does not guarantee that any garbage collection will be performed
            because it is ultimately up to the GC process to decide. A side effect of having this enabled means that opening and
            closing graphs could take longer to complete if the GC decides to clean up unused memory on a open or close.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Garbage Collect GC on graph open</li>
            <li>Garbage Collect GC on graph close</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Open GL</h2>
        <p>
            The Constellation graph is rendered via OpenGL so having extra debug information can be useful for troubleshooting or
            to see what is happening internally. We've provided a few options from this preferences section to include debugging
            options:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><em>Debug GL</em>:
                Prints out various debug parameters and settings detected by Constellation to the log file at start up.
            </li>
            <li><em>Print GL Capabilities</em>:
                Outputs the available GL capabilities detected by the graphics card to the log file.
            </li>
            <li><em>Display FPS Counter</em>:
                Have a frames per second counter visible on the bottom right corner showing you the frame rate for the Constellation
                graph. If you run the Experimental -&gt; Animations -&gt; Fly through then you can get a sense of the maximum frame
                rate possible with your graphics card.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Master Reset Constellation</h2>
        <p>
            Constellation is built on top of Apache Netbeans with a number of module suites and modules within those module suites.
            Running this option is a distruptive change that will uninstall all Constellation modules, stripping the application
            down to just the NetBeans runtime libraries.
        </p>
        <p>
            NOTE: This option does not work for the standalone version of Constellation and it rather applicable to the version of
            Constellation that is continuously updating via the update site mechanism. This version is called the "Constellation
            Shell".
