        <h1>Application Preferences</h1>       
        <p>
            Application preferences can be accessed via Setup -&gt; Options -&gt; CONSTELLATION -&gt; Application.
        </p>

        <h2>User Directory</h2>
        <p>
            The user directory is where Constellation stores user-specific data such as auto-save files, icons, and templates. By 
            default the user directory is "&lt;HomeDirectory&gt;/.CONSTELLATION". If you want to change your user directory, create 
            the new directory first, copy any files you want from the current directory to the new one, then change the directory in 
            preferences.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can open your user directory in your default file browser via Help -&gt; User Directory.
        </p>

        <h2>Autosave</h2>
        <p>
            By default, Constellation saves a copy of the graphs you're working on every five minutes. You can change this interval, 
            or disable autosave altogether in preferences.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Startup</h2>
        <p>
            By default, Constellation displays the Welcome page when on startup. The Welcome page can be hidden on startup either in 
            preferences or directly on the Welcome page via the "Show on Startup" tickbox option.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Internal Webserver</h2>
        <p>
            Constellation has a built in Restful web service allowing you to programatically run plugins via web calls. The web 
            service needs to be started manually from Tools -&gt; Start REST Service and it will by default listen to port 1517 on
            localhost. To reduce the risk of potential security vulnerabilities the web service is limited to localhost only.
        </p>       
        <p>
            You also have the ability make Restful calls via a file system. This can be handy if you have a shared folder that multiple
            VMs can access and want the ability to run commands over the network. To do this you can specify a "REST directory"
            and Constellation will poll that directory for plugins to run.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Jupyter Notebooks</h2>
        <p>
            The "Notebook directory" specifies the location where your Jupyter Notebooks are located and will launch the Jupyter
            Notebooks server from this directory. You can start the Jupyter Notebooks server from Constellation via Tools -&gt;
            Start Jupyter Notebook.
        </p>
        <p>
            Selecting to "Download Python REST client" means that when you start the Jupyter Notebook server, Constellation will
            download the constellation_client.py file to your .ipython folder. The constellation_client.py provides easy access
            to make Restful calls to Constellation.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Save Location</h2>
        <p>
            By default, Constellation goes your last save location when you go to save a file using "Save As". This can be altered in 
            preferences by unticking the "Remember Save Location" tickbox option. When this option is unticked, Constellation will
            default to the user's home directory instead.
