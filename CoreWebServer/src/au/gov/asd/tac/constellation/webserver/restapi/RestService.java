/**
 * The definition of a REST service.
 * <p>
 * REST services are accessed via the internal web server by REST clients.
 * They are not otherwise available from the CONSTELLATION user interface.
 * <p>
 * Services use createParameters() just like plugins. A PluginParameters
 * instance is populated by reading from the URL, no matter whether GET, POST,
 * or whatever is used. Service parameters are expected to be fairly simple,
 * so this shouldn't be a problem. Anything complex probably belongs in
 * a plugin, which you then use the run_plugin service to run.
 * <p>
 * The descriptive get() methods in RestService and PluginParameter are used to
 * dynamically build a Swagger config file: see SwaggerServlet for details.
 * <p>
 * All services are accessed via RestServiceServlet; see that for more details.
