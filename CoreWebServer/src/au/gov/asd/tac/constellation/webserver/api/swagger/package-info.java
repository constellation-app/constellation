/**
 * This package holds the template for the swagger definition JSON file.
 *
 * The basics are there, the rest is filled out dynamically by SwaggerServlet.
 *
 * The code in the swagger-ui package was obtained by
 * "git clone https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui.git",
 * copying the files in the dist directory to the swagger-ui package, and
 * modifying index.html so url points to constellation.json.
