# Online Help Preference

The Online Help Preference can be accessed via Setup -> Options -> 
CONSTELLATION -> Online Help.

This is where the user is able to set their preferred method of viewing the help
documentation. By default the option is selected, so the help documentation is
opened online. When the option is not selected, the help documentation is 
opened on a locally hosted webserver.
