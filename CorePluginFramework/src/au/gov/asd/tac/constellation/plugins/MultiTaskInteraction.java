/**
 * An adaptation of the {@link PluginInteraction} interface to facilitate interactions that are 
 * contributed to by multiple runnable tasks.
 * 
 * <p>This class does not substitute the need for plugins to communicate with the {@link PluginInteraction} but 
 * instead provides a simple way of updating the {@link PluginInteraction} from multiple threads.</P>
 * 
 * <p>This implementation has strengths and weaknesses that contributors should be aware of when using. 
 * Unlike single threaded uses of the {@link PluginInteraction}, the running plugin does not update by 
 * calling methods directly on the PluginInteraction. Instead, all running Tasks will implement the 
 * {@link SharedInteractionRunnable} and the MultiTaskInteraction will request updates on the 
 * completeness of their execution. It is then the MultiTaskInteraction that collates the status of all
 * running tasks and updates the {@link PluginInteraction} of execution completeness.</p>
 * 
 * <p>As {@link PluginInteraction} instances expect to be updated chronologically. Each step should be finished 
 * before commencing to the next step. To achieve this, the method {@code waitForTasksToComplete()} should 
 * be called after all tasks are scheduled so that the calling thread is forced to wait for all tasks to complete 
 * and prevent external calls to the {@link PluginInteraction}.</p>
