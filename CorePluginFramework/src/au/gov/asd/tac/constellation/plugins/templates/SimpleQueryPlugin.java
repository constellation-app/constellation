/**
 * A plugin template for a plugin that naturally works within a read-query-write
 * life cycle.
 * <p>
 * During the read stage, the plugin has a read lock on the graph and can
 * extract all required information from the graph. During the query stage, the
 * plugin has no lock on the graph and typically uses information derived during
 * the read stage to perform long-running calculations or long-running queries
 * on external databases. During the write stage, the plugin has a write lock on
 * the graph and is able to update the graph based on the results of the query
 * stage.
 * <p>
 * Using the read-query-write life cycle has the advantage that the plugin
 * releases all locks on the graph during the long query stage allowing the
 * graph to remain responsive the the user and other plugins during this time.
 * This also means that the plugin must elegantly handle the case where the
 * graph has been altered by another plugin during the query stage.
 * <p>
 * This template will:
 * <ol>
 * <li>Set the graph to busy.</li>
 * <li>Start the progress bar.</li>
 * <li>Get a read lock on the graph, call the read method, then release the
 * lock.</li>
 * <li>Call the query method.</li>
 * <li>Get a write lock on the graph, call the write method, then release the
 * lock.</li>
 * </ol>
