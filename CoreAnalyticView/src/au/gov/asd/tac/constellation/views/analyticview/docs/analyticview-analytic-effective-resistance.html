        <h1>Effective Resistance</h1>
        <p>
            Otherwise known as the Resistance Distance, this is a measure of the resistance that would be held
            by each link if it were an electrical network. This is achieved by replacing each link in the graph
            with a 1 ohm resistor (or if the weighted parameter is set to true, an n ohm resistor, where n is
            the weight of that link) and using Kirchoff's current/voltage laws to measure the resistance at
            each junction. These resistances highlight which paths are easy or difficult to traverse, and in
            general nodes which lie of easily traversable paths can be easily reached.
