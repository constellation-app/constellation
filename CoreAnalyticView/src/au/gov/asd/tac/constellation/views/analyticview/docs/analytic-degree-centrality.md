# Degree Centrality

In graph theory, centrality is any measure that determines how
structurally important a node is within a graph and the degree of a node
is a count of its neighbours.

Degree Centrality is a measure of a nodeâ€™s importance determined by the
number of nodes it is connected to (i.e. the degree of the node). The
higher the degree of the node, the more important it is.
