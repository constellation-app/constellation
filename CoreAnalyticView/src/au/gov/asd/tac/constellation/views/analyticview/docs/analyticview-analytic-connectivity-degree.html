        <h1>Connectivity Degree</h1>
        <p>
            In graph theory, a component is a group of nodes that are completely connected and a nodeâ€™s component
            size is the number of nodes in its component.
        </p>
        <p>
            The connectivity degree of a node is the number of components that nodes hold together. Deleting
            the node from the graph will result in a disconnected graph made up of a number of components equal
            to the connectivity degree.
