        <h1>Eigenvector Centrality</h1>
        <p>
            In graph theory, centrality is any measure that determines how structurally important a node is 
            within a graph and the degree of a node is a count of its neighbours.
        </p>
        <p>
            Eigenvector centrality is a measure of a node’s importance determined by the number of its neighbours, 
            as well as the average degree of its neighbours. A variation of degree centrality that is less biased 
            towards high degree nodes.
