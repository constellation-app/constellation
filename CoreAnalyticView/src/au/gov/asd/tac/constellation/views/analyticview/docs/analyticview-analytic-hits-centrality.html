        <h1>HITS Centrality</h1>
        <p>
            Hyperlink-Induced Topic Search (HITS) centrality is a link analysis algorithm that categorises nodes 
            into hubs or authorities.
        </p>
        <p>
            A hub is a node with incoming transactions from many neighbours and an authority is a node with 
            incoming transactions from many different hubs. Authorities hold influential positions in a network.
