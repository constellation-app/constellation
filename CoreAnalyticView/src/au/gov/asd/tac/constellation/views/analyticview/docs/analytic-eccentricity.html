        <h1>Eccentricity</h1>
        <p>
            In graph theory, distance is measured by the number of hops it takes to get from one point to
            another. The shortest path distance between two nodes is path that takes the minimum number of hops.
        </p>
        <p>
            The eccentricity of a node is the shortest path distance between it and the furthest node. It is a
            measure that can be used to determine whether a node is located in the middle of a network (low
            eccentricity), or on the outskirts of a network (high eccentricity).
