        <p>
            Similarity measures are used to determine how many features two entities have in common.

            See Resource Allocation Index. 
            The Adamic-Adar Index analytic calculates the fraction of a "resource" that a node can send to another through their common neighbours. 
            It is a variation of the Resource Allocation Index in that it is calculated by summing 1 divided by the log of the degree of each common neighbour node.
            The Soundarajan-Hopcroft Community Adamic-Adar Index parameter will only score pairs of nodes that are both selected (that is, sharing resources within the same community).
