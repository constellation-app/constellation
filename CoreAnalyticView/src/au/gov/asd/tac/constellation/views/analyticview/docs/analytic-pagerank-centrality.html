        <h1>Pagerank Centrality</h1>
        <p>
            In graph theory, centrality is any measure that determines how structurally important a node is within a graph.
        </p>
        <p>
            Pagerank Centrality is a measure of a nodeâ€™s importance calculated by counting the number and quality of incoming 
            transactions. The assumption is that important nodes are more likely to receive transactions from other nodes.

        <h2>Parameters</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><em>Transaction Types</em> - 
                Calculate on only the subgraph of transactions of these types
            </li>
            <li><em>Include Undirected</em> - 
                Treat undirected connections as bidirectional connections
            </li>
            <li><em>Damping Factor</em> - 
                The damping factor to apply at each iteration
            </li>
            <li><em>Iterations</em> - 
                The number of iterations to run before returning a result
            </li>
            <li><em>Epsilon</em> - 
                The change threshold at which equilibrium can be considered reached
            </li>
            <li><em>Normalise By Max Available Score</em> - 
                Normalise calculated scores by the maximum calculated score
            </li>
        </ul>
