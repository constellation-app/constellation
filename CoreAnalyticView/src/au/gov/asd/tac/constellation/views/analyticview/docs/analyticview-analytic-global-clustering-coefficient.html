        <h1>Global Clustering Coefficient</h1>
        <p>
            In graph theory, a clustering coefficient is a measure of the extent to which nodes in a graph tend 
            to cluster together. A triplet consists of three nodes that are connected by either two (open triplet) 
            or three (closed triplet) undirected ties. A triangle consists of three closed triplets, one centred 
            on each of the nodes.
        </p>
        <p>
            The global clustering coefficient is the number of closed triplets (or 3 x triangles) over the total 
            number of triplets (both open and closed). It provides an overall indication of the clustering in the 
            network.
