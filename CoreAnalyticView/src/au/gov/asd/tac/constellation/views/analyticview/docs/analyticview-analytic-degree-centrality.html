        <h1>Degree Centrality</h1>
        <p>
            In graph theory, centrality is any measure that determines how structurally important a node is 
            within a graph and the degree of a node is a count of its neighbours.
        </p>
        <p>
            Degree centrality is a measure of a nodeâ€™s importance determined by the number of its neighbours. 
            The more neighbours a node has, the more important it is.
