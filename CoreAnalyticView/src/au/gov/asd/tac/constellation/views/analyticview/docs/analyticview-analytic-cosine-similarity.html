        <p>
            Similarity measures are used to determine how many features two entities have in common.

            The Cosine Similarity is a measure of the angle between the feature vectors of two nodes. The features 
            used to determine similarity with cosine similarity are a node's neighbours, including the direction, 
            types and weight of the transactions connecting them. A nodeâ€™s features are converted into vectors, 
            (geometric objects defined by a magnitude and a direction), and similarity is then measured by 
            comparing the direction of the vectors of two nodes. Similar vectors will point in similar directions.
