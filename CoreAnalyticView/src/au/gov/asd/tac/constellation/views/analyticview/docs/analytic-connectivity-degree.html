        <h1>Connectivity Degree</h1>
        <p>
            In graph theory, a component is a group of nodes that are completely connected and a nodeâ€™s component
            size is the number of nodes in its component.
        </p>
        <p>
            The connectivity degree of a node is the number of components that node holds together. Deleting
            the node from the graph will result in a disconnected graph made up of a number of components equal
            to the connectivity degree.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Parameters</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><em>Transaction Types</em> - 
                Calculate on only the subgraph of transactions of these types
            </li>
            <li><em>Include Incoming</em> - 
                Include incoming connections
            </li>
            <li><em>Include Outgoing</em> - 
                Include outgoing connections
            </li>
            <li><em>Include Undirected</em> - 
                Treat undirected connections as bidirectional connections
            </li>
            <li><em>Ignore Singletons</em> - 
                Singletons are not treated as graph components
            </li>
            <li><em>Normalise Score</em> - 
                Score should indicate the number of components on the graph if the vertex was deleted. 
                Otherwise, it indicates how many components are added if the vertex was deleted
            </li>
        </ul>
