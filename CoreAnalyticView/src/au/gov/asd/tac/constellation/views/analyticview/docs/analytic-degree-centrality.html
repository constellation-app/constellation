        <h1>Degree Centrality</h1>
        <p>
            In graph theory, centrality is any measure that determines how structurally important a node is within a graph and the 
            degree of a node is a count of its neighbours.
        </p>
        <p>
            Degree Centrality is a measure of a nodeâ€™s importance determined by the number of nodes it is connected to (i.e. the 
            degree of the node). The higher the degree of the node, the more important it is.
