        <h1>Cosine Similarity</h1>
        <p>
            Similarity measures are used to determine how many features two entities have in common.

            Cosine Similarity, in general, is used to determine how similar two vectors (geometric objects defined by a magnitude and 
            a direction) are based on the cosine of the angle between them. For a graph, these vectors are composed of features or 
            behaviours represented by the network (eg. node A contacted node B, node A is correlated to node B). This basically 
            results in a high similarity score being assigned to any pair of nodes which are connected to similar neighbours a similar 
            amount of times.
