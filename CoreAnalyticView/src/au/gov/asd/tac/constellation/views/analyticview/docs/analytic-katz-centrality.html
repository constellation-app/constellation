        <h1>Katz Centrality</h1>
        <p>
            In graph theory, centrality is any measure that determines how structurally important a node is within a graph.
        </p>
        <p>
            Katz Centrality computes the influence of a node by calculating the number of neighbours, and other nodes on the graph 
            that connect to the node through these immediate neighbours. Connections made with distant neighbours are penalised by an 
            attenuation factor. It is a variation of Eigenvector Centrality that incorporates the direction of transactions. 
        </p>
        <p>
            There is major drawback to using Katz Centrality - if a node with high centrality is pointing to lots of other nodes, they 
            will also get high centrality. e.g. If you have a node on your graph with over 1000 neighbours and this node has a high 
            centrality, all of those neighbours would also score highly, which would not be especially useful analytically. PageRank 
            Centrality, the algorithm used by Google to rank search results, attempts to resolve this issue by evenly distributing the 
            centrality a node has to share.
