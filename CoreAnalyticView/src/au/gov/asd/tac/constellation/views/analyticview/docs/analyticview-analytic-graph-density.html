        <h1>Graph Density</h1>
        <p>
            The density of a graph is a ratio of the number of edges on the graph compared to the number of edges 
            that could possibly exist. A dense graph is a graph in which the number of edges is close to the 
            maximal number of edges. A graph with only a few edges is a sparse graph.
