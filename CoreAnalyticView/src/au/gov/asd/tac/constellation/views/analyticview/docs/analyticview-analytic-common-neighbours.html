        <p>
            Similarity measures are used to determine how many features two entities have in common.

            The Common Neighbours analytic calculates the number of common neighbours between two nodes. 
            The Soundarajan-Hopcroft Common Community Neighbours parameter will add a bonus of 1 to the score if both nodes are selected.
