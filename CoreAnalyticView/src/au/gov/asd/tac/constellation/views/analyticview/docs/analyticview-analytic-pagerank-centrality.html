        <h1>Pagerank Centrality</h1>
        <p>
            In graph theory, centrality is any measure that determines how structurally important a node is 
            within a graph.

        <p>
            Pagerank centrality is a measure of a node’s importance calculated by counting the number and quality 
            of incoming transactions. The assumption is that important nodes are more likely to receive 
            transactions from other nodes.
