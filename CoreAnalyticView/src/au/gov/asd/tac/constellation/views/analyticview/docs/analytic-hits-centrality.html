        <h1>HITS Centrality</h1>
        <p>
            In graph theory, centrality is any measure that determines how structurally important a node is within a graph.
        </p>
        <p>
            Hyperlink-Induced Topic Search (HITS) Centrality is a link analysis algorithm that categorises nodes 
            into hubs or authorities.
        </p>
        <p>
            A hub is a node with incoming transactions from many neighbours and an authority is a node with 
            incoming transactions from many different hubs. Authorities hold influential positions in a network.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Parameters</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><em>Transaction Types</em> - 
                Calculate on only the subgraph of transactions of these types
            </li>
            <li><em>Iterations</em> - 
                The number of iterations to run before returning a result
            </li>
            <li><em>Epsilon</em> - 
                The change threshold at which equilibrium can be considered reached
            </li>
            <li><em>Normalise By Max Available</em> - 
                Normalise calculated scores by the maximum calculated score
            </li>
        </ul>
