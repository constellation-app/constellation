        <h1>Ratio of Reciprocity</h1>
        <p>
            Ratio of Reciprocity is a simple ratio of the number of incoming transactions to the number of outgoing transactions. This 
            produces an importance score where lower scores indicate more one-sided relationships, and higher scores indicate more 
            reciprocal relationships. You can use this to compare the neighbours of a node and rank them in order from most 
            reciprocated to most one-sided.

        <h2>Parameters</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><em>Transaction Types</em> - 
                Calculate on only the subgraph of transactions of these types
            </li>
            <li><em>Include Undirected</em> - 
                Treat undirected connections as bidirectional connections
            </li>
            <li><em>Normalise By Max Available Score</em> - 
                Normalise calculated scores by the maximum calculated score
            </li>
        </ul>
