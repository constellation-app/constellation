        <h1>Eigenvector Centrality</h1>
        <p>
            In graph theory, centrality is any measure that determines how structurally important a node is within a graph and the 
            degree of a node is a count of its neighbours.
        </p>
        <p>
            Eigenvector Centrality is a measure of a node’s importance determined by the number of neighbours, and the average degree 
            of its neighbours. It is a variation of Degree Centrality that is less biased towards high degree nodes.
