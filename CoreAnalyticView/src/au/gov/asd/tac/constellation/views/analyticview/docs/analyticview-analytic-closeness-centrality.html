        <h1>Closeness Centrality</h1>
        <p>
            In graph theory, centrality is any measure that determines how structurally important a node is
            within a graph and distance is measured by the number of hops it takes from get from one point to
            another. The shortest path distance between two nodes is path that takes the minimum number of hops.
        </p>
        <p>
            Closeness centrality is a measure of a nodeâ€™s importance determined by the average shortest path
            distance from that node to every other node on the graph. The lower the average distance to all
            other nodes, the more central the position in the network.
