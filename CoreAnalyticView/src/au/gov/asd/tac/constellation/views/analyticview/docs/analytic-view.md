## Introduction

The Analytic View is a tool for computing analytics across a graph in a
user-friendly manner. This is done by posing complex algorithms as
simple questions you might ask of the graph. These algorithms range in
functionality from scoring based on the structure of a graph, to
clustering and partitioning the graph, and even analysing content stored
on a graph.

## Asking a Question

There are a couple of ways you can define a question you want to answer
for your graph. The first option is to choose a pre-defined question
from the "Questions" list. The "Analytics" list will be populated with
the analytics specified by that question. The alternative option is to
define your own custom question by selecting a category under the
"Categories" list, and then selecting any number of analytics found the
"Analytics" list.

For each of the analytics selected, parameters can be viewed in the pane
at the bottom of the Analytic View. For a pre-defined question these
parameter values are pre-defined and can't be edited but are
configurable if constructing a custom-made question. You can also view
help pages for selected analytics here by clicking on the
"Documentation" tab.

Once you have finished configuring your question, you can run it by
pressing the <img src="../constellation/CoreAnalyticView/src/au/gov/asd/tac/constellation/views/analyticview/docs/resources/AnalyticRun.png" alt="Run Icon" />
button.

## Visualising the Results

Once a question has finished running, the results are compiled into a
table which is displayed at the top of the view. You can also visualise
these results on the graph with options to add color, size, and
show/hide filters.
