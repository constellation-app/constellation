# Graph Distance

In graph theory, distance is measured by the number of hops it takes to
get from one point to another. The shortest path distance between two
nodes is the path that takes the minimum number of hops. The
eccentricity of a node is the shortest path distance between it and the
furthest node. The radius of a graph is the minimum eccentricity. The
diameter of a graph is the maximum eccentricity.
