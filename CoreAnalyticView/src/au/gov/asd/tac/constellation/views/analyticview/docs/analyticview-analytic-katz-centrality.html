        <h1>Katz Centrality</h1>
        <p>
            In graph theory, centrality is any measure that determines how structurally important a node is 
            within a graph.
        </p>
        <p>
            Katz centrality computes the influence of a node by calculating the number of the neighbours, and 
            other nodes on the graph that connect to the node through these immediate neighbours. Connections 
            made with distant neighbours are penalised by an attenuation factor. It is a variation of eigenvector 
            centrality that incorporates the direction of transactions.
