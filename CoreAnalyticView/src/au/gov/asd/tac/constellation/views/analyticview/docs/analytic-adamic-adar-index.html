        <h1>Adamic-Adar Index</h1>
        <p>
            Similarity measures are used to determine how many features two entities have in common.
        </p>
        <p>
            See Resource Allocation Index. 
            The Adamic-Adar Index analytic calculates the fraction of a "resource" that a node can send to another through their common neighbours. 
            It is a variation of the Resource Allocation Index in that it is calculated by summing 1 divided by the log of the degree of each common neighbour node.
            The Soundarajan-Hopcroft Community Adamic-Adar Index parameter will only score pairs of nodes that are both selected (that is, sharing resources within the same community).

        <h2>Parameters</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><em>Transaction Types</em> - 
                Calculate on only the subgraph of transactions of these types
            </li>
            <li><em>Include Incoming</em> - 
                Include incoming connections
            </li>
            <li><em>Include Outgoing</em> - 
                Include outgoing connections
            </li>
            <li><em>Include Undirected</em> - 
                Treat undirected connections as bidirectional connections
            </li>
            <li><em>Minimum Common Features</em> - 
                Only calculate similarity between nodes that share at least this many features
            </li>
            <li><em>Selected Only</em> - 
                Calculate using only selected graph elements
            </li>
            <li><em>Community Adamic-Adar Index Soundarajan-Hopcroft Score</em> - 
                Only calculates score when both nodes are selected
            </li>
