        <h1>Common Neighbours</h1>
        <p>
            Similarity measures are used to determine how many features two entities have in common.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Common Neighbours analytic calculates the number of common neighbours between two nodes. 
            The Soundarajan-Hopcroft Common Community Neighbours parameter will add a bonus of 1 to the score if both nodes are selected.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Parameters</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><em>Transaction Types</em> - 
                Calculate on only the subgraph of transactions of these types
            </li>
            <li><em>Include Incoming</em> - 
                Include incoming connections
            </li>
            <li><em>Include Outgoing</em> - 
                Include outgoing connections
            </li>
            <li><em>Include Undirected</em> - 
                Treat undirected connections as bidirectional connections
            </li>
            <li><em>Minimum Common Features</em> - 
                Only calculate similarity between nodes that share at least this many features
            </li>
            <li><em>Selected Only</em> - 
                Calculate using only selected graph elements
            </li>
            <li><em>Common Neighbours Soundarajan-Hopcroft Score</em> - 
                If both nodes are selected, adds bonus of 1 to score
            </li>
        </ul>
