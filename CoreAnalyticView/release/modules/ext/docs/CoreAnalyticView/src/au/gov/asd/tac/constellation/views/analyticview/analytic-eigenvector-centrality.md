# Eigenvector Centrality

In graph theory, centrality is any measure that determines how
structurally important a node is within a graph and the degree of a node
is a count of its neighbours.

Eigenvector Centrality is a measure of a nodeâ€™s importance determined by
the number of neighbours, and the average degree of its neighbours. It
is a variation of Degree Centrality that is less biased towards high
degree nodes.

## Parameters

    considered reached
-   *Normalise By Max Possible Score* - Normalise calculated scores by
    the maximum possible score
