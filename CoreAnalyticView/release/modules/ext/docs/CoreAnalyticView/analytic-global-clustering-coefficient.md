# Global Clustering Coefficient

In graph theory, a clustering coefficient is a measure of the extent to
which nodes in a graph tend to cluster together. A triplet consists of
three nodes that are connected by either two (open triplet) or three
(closed triplet) undirected ties. A triangle consists of three closed
triplets, one centred on each of the nodes.

The global clustering coefficient is the number of closed triplets (or 3
x triangles) over the total number of triplets (both open and closed).
It provides an overall indication of the clustering in the network.
