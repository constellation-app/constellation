# Levenshtein Distance

Used to compare the similarity of a node string attribute.

The Levenshtein Distance is calculated by comparing two strings, and
calculating the number of character additions, deletions, and
substitutions required to convert one string into the other.

## Parameters

-   *Transaction Types* - Calculate on only the subgraph of transactions
    of these types
-   *Compare Attribute* - The node attribute to compare
-   *Maximum Distance* - Only draws links between nodes whose attributes
    are at most this far apart
-   *Case Insensitive* - Ignore case when comparing attribute
-   *Selected Only* - Compare selected nodes only
