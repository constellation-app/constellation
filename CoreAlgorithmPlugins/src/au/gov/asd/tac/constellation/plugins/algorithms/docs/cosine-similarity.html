        <h1>Cosine Similarity</h1>
        <p>
            Cosine Similarity, in general, is used to determine how similar two vectors are based on the cosine of the angle between them.
            For a graph, these vectors are composed of features or behaviours represented by the network (eg. node A contacted node B, 
            node A is correlated to node B). This basically results in a high similarity score being assigned to any pair of nodes which 
            are connected to similar neighbours a similar amount of times.
