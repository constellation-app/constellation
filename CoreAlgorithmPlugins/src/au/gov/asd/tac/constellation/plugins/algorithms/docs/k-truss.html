        <h1>K-Truss</h1>
        <p>
            The k-Truss plugin is used to find highly connected groups of nodes in a graph. The plugin will assign an integer attribute "highest k-truss" to each node and transaction.
            This value will be the largest value of k for which the node/transaction is in a k-truss (see below for an explanation of k-trusses). This attribute can be used like
            a cluster attribute, but perhaps more useful is the ability to explore the k-trusses in the graph using the K-Truss Visibility panel. This panel is opened automatically
            after running the K-Truss plugin, but can be accessed at any time from the menu via "Tools &rarr; Clustering &rarr; K-Truss". Note that it is disabled for a graph unless
            the K-Truss plugin has previously been run on that graph.</p>
        <br/>
        <h2>K-Trusses Explained</h2>
        <p>
            For some whole number k, bigger than or equal to 3, a k-Truss is a graph (or part thereof) where every transaction lies in at least k-2 triangles.
            For example, in a 3-truss every transaction lies in at least 1 triangle, while in a 4-truss, every transaction lies in at least 2 triangles.
            There is no upper limit on the number of nodes in a k-truss, but it must have at least k nodes, otherwise there are not enough triangles.
            A k-truss captures the idea of a group of nodes with a particular level of interconnectivity - the higher the value of k is, the greater the interconnection between nodes.
            Note that a k-truss is also a j-truss for all values of j which are smaller than k. </p>
        <br/>
        <h1>Using the Visibility Panel</h1>
        <p>
            The K-Truss Visibility panel contains a number of features for visualising k-trusses and the relationships between them. The simplest and most useful feature is the visibility slider.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <h2>Visibility Slider</h2>
        <br/>
        <em>Select the value of k for which to display nodes and transactions in k-trusses</em>
        <p>
            The visibility slider ranges over all possible values of k for viewing k-trusses in the graph.
            Dragging the slider to a specific value of k will display only nodes and transactions which are in a k-truss. Nodes which are not displayed will be either dimmed (default) or hidden.
            The slider starts at 3, the lowest possible value of k. There is also an "all" value which displays the entire graph.
            The numbers in bold show where the display will change. For example if 5 is in bold, then there are 5-trusses in the graph which are not 6-trusses, and hence dragging the slider
            from 5 to 6 will change the display. If 5 was not bold, it would mean that all 5-trusses are also 6-trusses, and hence dragging the slider from 5 to 6 will not change the display.
            You should gradually move the slider to higher values in bold, so as to focus on smaller and more highly connected parts of the graph.

        </p>
        <br/>
        <h2>Excluded Elements Options</h2>
        <br/>
        <em>Select whether to dim or hide nodes and transactions which are not displayed (excluded) by the visibility slider</em>
        <p>
            The two radio buttons allow you to dynamically switch between dimming (default) or hiding the nodes and transactions which would not be displayed
            based on the visibility slider's current position. You should use dimming to get an idea of where k-trusses fit in to the graph as a whole. Hiding is more useful when
            you want to only look at the k-trusses for some value of k.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <h2>Select K-Trusses</h2>
        <br/>
        <em>Select nodes and transactions on the graph which are in k-trusses, where k is the current value of the visibility slider</em>
        <p>
            This option allows you to select all the nodes and transactions which are being displayed by the visibility slider. You are then able to use this
            selection as you would any other selection. You might find it useful to open the selection in another graph (Ctrl+U) for closer analysis of the k-trusses.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <h2>Color Nested K-Trusses</h2>
        <br/>
        <em>Color nodes and transactions based on the largest value of k for which they are in a k-truss</em>
        <p>
            This button allows you to color the k-trusses in your graph with a different color for each k. This means for example, that if a 4-truss contains a smaller 5-truss,
            then the nodes and transactions in the 4-truss but not the 5-truss will be a different color to those in both the 4-truss and the 5-truss. This button acts as a toggle,
            allowing you to return to your original coloring. You should use this feature if you want to see how more highly connected parts of your graph are nested inside less highly connected parts.</p>
        <br/>
        <h2>Nested K-Trusses Display Panel</h2>
        <br/>
        <em>Display rectangles which represent the connected components of the k-trusses</em>
        <p>
            Pressing the down arrow beneath the visibility slider on the left will expand the panel to reveal a display of rectangles arranged in columns beneath the slider. The columns line
            up with the numbers on the slider. The column below the number k has a rectangle for every connected component of the k-truss in the graph. The height of the rectangles is proportional
            to the number of nodes in the connected component they represent. You can see that as you move to higher values of k, the number and size of the rectangles decreases.
            You can use this panel to visualise how the k-trusses nest inside each other, as well as their relative sizes. Clicking the up arrow button will hide the panel again.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <h2>Show All Components</h2>
        <br/>
        <em>Shows connected components of the entire graph as well as of the k-trusses</em>
        <p>
            This is a toggle button which if set will show connected components in the "all" column, that is connected components of the entire graph as well as connected components of the k-trusses.
            This will rescale all the rectangles so that their heights are now proportional to the total number of nodes in the graph, rather than the total number of nodes in some k-truss. You should only
            use this option if a large proportion of the nodes in your graph are in k-trusses. Note that this button is disabled when the nested trusses display panel is hidden.</p>
