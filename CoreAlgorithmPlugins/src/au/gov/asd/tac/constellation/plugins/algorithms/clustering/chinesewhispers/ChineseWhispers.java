/**
 * Chinese whispers clustering based on BiemannTextGraph06.
 * <p>
 * Chinese Whispers - an Efficient Graph Clustering Algorithm and its
 * Application to Natural Language processing Problems. Chris Biemann University
 * of Liepzig, NLP Department
 * <p>
 * Intuitively, the algorithm works as follows in a bottom-up fashion: First all
 * nodes get different classes. Then the nodes are processed for a small number
 * of iterations and inherit the strongest class in the local neighborhood. This
 * is the class whose sum of edge weights to the current node is maximal. In
 * case of multiple strongest classes, one is chosen randomly. Regions of the
 * same class stabilize during the iteration and grow until they reach the
 * border of a stable region of another class. Note that classes are updated
 * immediately: a node can obtain classes from the neighborhood that were
 * introduced there in the same iteration.
 * <pre>
 * initialize: forall vi in V: class(vi)=i while changes: forall v in V,
 * randomized order: class(v)=highest ranked class in neighborhood of v;
 * </pre> Apart from ties, the classes usually do not change any more after a
 * handful of iterations. The number of iterations depends on the diameter of
 * the graph: the larger the distance between two nodes is, the more iterations
 * it takes to percolate information from one to another.
