        <p>
            Shortest Paths is an implementation of the Dijkstra shortest paths algorithm.  When nodes within the same component are 
            selected, the Shortest Paths function will determine the path(s) with the smallest number of transactions between the 
            selected nodes, and highlight the nodes and transactions along the path(s).
        </p>
        
        <h2>Directed Shortest Paths</h2>
        <p>
            Directed Shortest Paths runs in a similar way except it only looks at paths with directed transactions going in the 
            direction of the source node to the destination node. When you select Directed Shortest Paths, a dialog box pops up 
            prompting you to choose which node you have selected is the source node.
