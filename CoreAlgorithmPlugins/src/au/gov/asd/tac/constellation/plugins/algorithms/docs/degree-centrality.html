        <h1>Degree Centrality</h1>
        <p>
            Degree Centrality was the first centrality measure, and is also the most basic conceptually. It uses the degree 
            of the node (ie. the number of transactions connecting the node to other nodes) to determine how important a node 
            is. The higher the degree, the more important the node is considered. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In-degree Centrality works in much the same way as Degree Centrality, with the difference being that it only takes 
            incoming transactions into account when determining importance.
        </p>
        <p>
            Similarly, Out-degree Centrality only takes outgoing transactions into account when determining importance. Note 
            that the degree of a node is equal to the sum of its in-degree and out-degree.
