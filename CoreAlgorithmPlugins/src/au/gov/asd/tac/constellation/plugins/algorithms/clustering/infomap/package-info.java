/**
 * This package is a port from C++ of the Infomap software package. See
 * http://www.mapequation.org/.
 * <p>
 * The original C++ code (wrapped in a NetBeans project) has had many debugging
 * print statements added to it, and a custom random number generator is used so
 * both it and the Java port could generate reproducable output. When compared,
 * the output from the C++ code and Java code is effectively the same.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For future reference, the original C++ code is in the zip file
 * Infomap-0.13.0-debugging.zip in this package.
