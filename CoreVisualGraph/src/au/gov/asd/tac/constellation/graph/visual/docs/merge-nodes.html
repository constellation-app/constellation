        <h2>Merge Nodes</h2>
        <p>
            Merge all the selected nodes into a single node.<BR>
            Alters the structure of the graph by deleting all but one of the nodes and reconnecting all the
            transactions to the remaining node. Requires at least two selected nodes.<BR>
            <BR>
            Clicking the command from the menu "Tools &rarr; Merge Nodes", the application presents the following panel to the user.<BR>
            <BR>

            Click the <strong>OK</strong> button to execute the merge operation.
            <BR>
        <h3>Identifying the merge nodes</h3>
        <P>
            By default, all of the nodes are selected for merging. The selected nodes are marked in the table by the
            check box in the left-most column. Any node can be excluded/included from the merge operation by either
            clicking in the checkbox or using the <strong>Include All</strong> or <strong>Include All</strong> actions in the lower left-hand
            corner of the panel.<BR>
            <BR>
            The total number of selected nodes is displayed in the lower right-hand corner of the panel.</P>
        <h3>Identification of attributes</h3>
        <P>
            By default, the final merge node will get a copy of all the attributes of the first node listed in the table.<BR>
            Clicking an individual cell in each column will identify the attribute values to be copied to the merged node.
            Alternatively, clicking an <strong>ID</strong> value will select all the attributes values of the given row.
